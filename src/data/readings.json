It was as much as most of them could do to remember what it was that Microsoft had done to end up in court. Even Marc Andreessen was much keener to talk about the new businesses he was investing in than his epic struggle against Bill Gates while at Netscape. His attitude was: been there; done that; move on. When Microsoft’s witnesses were confronted with damning e-mails they’d written only a couple of years before, it is just possible their surprise and struggle to guess what they might have meant at the time wasn’t completely phony. Ellison doesn’t suffer from that kind of amnesia, but even though he reads history voraciously and tries to learn from it, what really interests him is not the last five years but the next five. To Ellison, the present and the near future elide so gracefully as to be almost indistinguishable. And when talking about software, last year is another country.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"9d82cde3-2ffb-4706-8ecc-69e25522c797","text":"After apologizing profusely for his lateness, he began to talk about technology. His theme was the failure of the prevailing computer architecture of the day, known as client/server (because the job of running software was shared between server computers in corporate data centers and their desktop PC “clients”). He believed client/server was an “evolutionary dead end” that was “distributing complexity” with disastrous consequences. The answer was a new model of computing based on the Internet, in which the complexity and the computing would be hidden in the network. Users would be able to access everything they needed through a web browser that could be run by a machine much less expensive and cantankerous than a PC—a network computer. There was nothing unexpected in this. It was a drum that Ellison had been beating for some time, and conceptually it was little different from Sun Microsystems’s famous slogan that “the network is the computer.” Ellison had first declared the PC “a ridiculous device” at a technology conference in Paris more than two years earlier. The speech, at the height of the hoopla surrounding the release of Windows 95 and in front of an audience that included Bill Gates, caused a minor sensation.1","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"eb34cf5c-31fd-45a8-942d-e2dee2182e7f","text":"The network computer itself proved to be a dazzling digression: Ellison had been right about how the Internet would change the way computers were used, but most people still reckoned that the best way of getting to the Internet was through a PC. A few network computers were made by Oracle and a loosely knit coalition of Microsoft’s enemies, such as IBM and Sun Microsystems, but tumbling PC prices and the limitations imposed by slow dial-up connections quickly condemned them to irrelevance. Microsoft crowed; Ellison was made to look a bit foolish. But the PC versus the NC was a sideshow that stole attention from the real struggle for the future of computing. What mattered was that Ellison had understood better than anyone the potential impact of the Internet on enterprise computing in general and on Oracle in particular.2 While the technology analysts in the investment banks and the consultancies confidently predicted the maturing of the database market, Ellison realized that the Internet would exponentially increase both the number of database transactions and the number of people who would interact with Oracle’s databases. That would mean more license growth than the analysts had dreamed of. Every time someone looked for a book on Amazon.com, bought stock through E*TRADE, or put something up for auction on eBay, that person was using an Oracle database. Ellison believed that the database would be the essential platform for Internet computing, effectively displacing the once all-important operating system.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"f13f2f89-0b53-460a-a0b3-0a386565ec6d","text":"Instead of business software being used by only a handful of specialists, Internet-based applications could be extended to anyone with authorization and a browser. Every time one of those applications was used, there was a good chance that it would query the database that the application ran on. When the networking giant Cisco Systems talked of having a “URL for everything we do,” it was another way of saying that everybody they employed was constantly using the firm’s Oracle database. In a client/server world, less sophisticated databases, such as Microsoft’s SQL Server, might have become “good enough” for many businesses, but with Internet computing came the need for databases that could support millions of users at once. With the coming of e-business, Oracle’s databases became at least as much an essential element of infrastructure as Cisco’s routers or the big server computers made by the likes of Sun that were also back in fashion. It was no coincidence that in early 2000 those three companies—the three superstars of the Internet—had a combined market value of nearly a trillion dollars.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"0541c266-fa10-4736-8890-62812484ea5e","text":"Ellison was convinced that Oracle was now poised to claim the mantle that Microsoft had snatched from IBM. But while these two companies’ reigns had been temporary, Ellison reckoned Oracle could be on top for a very long time.

The consequence, Ellison argued, was that it was no longer necessary to hire expensive systems integrators from IBM or Accenture to glue together market-leading applications from different software vendors—the practice known as bringing together best-of-breed. “Building an integrated system out of several different software products that were never designed to work together is a very difficult task. At Oracle, we used to sell and deliver these best-of-breed systems; selling was easy, delivery was hard. IBM has thousands of consultants eager to help you make it work. The more complex the integration project the more likely it will be late and over budget. It may even fail completely. And in the end it’s the customer who assumes the financial risk for the success or failure of these projects. This best-of-breed software product assembly approach is absolutely unique to the computer industry. If Detroit ran like Silicon Valley, nobody would sell cars—just parts. Customers would have to figure out which were the ‘best’ parts—a Honda engine, a Ford transmission, a BMW chassis, GM electrical system—and buy them and try to assemble them into a working car. Good luck.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"22f36a0c-0283-4cb3-a32f-320fe9540065","text":"Although he always talked about technology and Oracle with passion and intensity, he didn’t have the methodical relentlessness that made Bill Gates so formidable and feared. By his own admission, Ellison was not an obsessive grinder like Gates: “I am a sprinter. I rest, I sprint, I rest, I sprint again.” Ellison had a reputation for being easily bored by the process of running a business and often took time off, leaving the shop to senior colleagues. One of the reasons often trotted out for Oracle’s success in the 1990s was Ellison’s decision to hire Ray Lane, a senior executive credited with bringing order and discipline to the business, allowing Ellison just to do the vision thing and bunk off to sail his boats whenever he felt like it. But Lane had left Oracle nearly eighteen months before after falling out with Ellison. Since then, Ellison had taken full control of the company—how likely was it that he would he stay the course?","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"9e9da760-3485-45ec-999a-8411fdf10f10","text":"One reason to be skeptical was that Ellison just seemed to have too many things going on in his life besides Oracle. During the afternoon, we took a break from discussing the future of computing to take a tour of what would be his new home—nearly a decade in the making, and at that time, still nearly three years from completion. In the hills of Woodside, California, framing a five-acre artificial lake, six wooden Japanese houses, perfect replicas of the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century originals in Kyoto, were under construction. The site also contained two full-size ornamental bridges, hundreds of boulders trucked in from the high Sierras and arranged according to Zen principles and an equal number of cherry trees jostling for attention next to towering redwoods.

The story is rambling and funny, but the message is clear. By streamlining its processes and using its own software and the Internet to automate them, Oracle not only saved $1 billion in annual costs but became an organization that was far more responsive to the needs of its customers. What’s more, as all this had been achieved by centralizing information and going from literally thousands of server computers to just a handful, it meant being prepared to spend less, not more, on information technology. The obstacle to realizing such gains was no longer technological, it was whether the people within a company were prepared to embrace change, and that wouldn’t happen unless senior management was ready to think how the business should operate for the next twenty-five years in the light of the Internet. Ellison ends with the challenge “Are you willing to pay less?

His line on e-commerce is that the Internet can make good companies better, but it won’t turn bad businesses into good ones. He reckons that there won’t turn out to be that many brand-new companies created by the Internet; mostly it’s a question of existing firms getting smarter and more efficient. “Dot-com mania,” he says, “was a fantasy, the world had gone a little bit crazy.” On the training issue, he says, “When we say there’s a training problem, it’s usually because a product is too difficult to use. If you can use Yahoo! or Amazon without any training, you should be able to use most business software with little or no training.

A big part of his message is that Oracle’s customers should install the software in “plain vanilla” form and avoid expensive modifications. But he suddenly makes the extraordinary claim that Oracle is intending to get the initial purchase price of the applications suite for small businesses down to $20,000 and get the software up and running almost before the ink dries on the contract—in other words, in just a few hours. Williams looks astonished, but it’s quintessential Ellison; because he’s already worked out in his own mind how something like this could, in theory, be done, it follows that all the practical difficulties have already been overcome.1","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"1f90e42c-d233-4359-9271-176f53165a0e","text":"It’s also an opportunity to expound on a core Ellison theme: “the war against complexity.” Software has to be made much more simple.

What makes him so sure is that Internet-based computer networks work in a way similar to all the other networks that we depend on, from water, as invented by the Romans, to electricity and the telephone. The second is that migration from client/server to the Internet isn’t trivial but shouldn’t take too long. As long as Oracle can get the time with senior managers to work out how to change, standardize, and simplify every business process for the Internet, implementation can be very rapid—the model used so successfully with GE Power, he claims.

They want to know what he thinks will happen to the Nasdaq—four of the firms represented are stockbrokers with a lot of very perplexed clients—and whether the U.S. economy is going into recession. They also seem fascinated by the power cuts in California.

At last Ellison gets the chance to pitch the E-Business Suite. To their surprise, Ellison explains that Microsoft isn’t really a direct rival. Oracle’s main competitors are the sprawling computer behemoth IBM and the leading business application firms, such as SAP and Siebel Systems, whose products IBM and other system integrators expensively try to knit together. The contrast is their complexity versus Oracle’s simplicity.

The Oracle events managers, who have organized Ellison’s itinerary, are horrified: “What the fuck’s he doing there?” As other equally self-serving questions from the audience come in, the thought comes to Ellison that maybe there are other Oracle plants among the guests. “Er . . . just how many people are there here from Oracle?” he asks nervously.

At Oracle, this has become tantamount to heresy; a big part of the EBS campaign is to convince customers to take the software in “plain vanilla” form and install it rapidly without modifications. Wohl says that it may be possible to sort things out at a meeting of the GE-Oracle steering committee in a fortnight. But if that fails, either he or Ellison may have to go back to GE Power Systems’ boss and current Oracle poster boy, John Rice, and persuade him to tell the Houston people to see sense. Ellison has a better idea. Tell Houston, he says, they must write down on paper exactly why they have to be different from Hungary. Don’t let them argue about it at the steering committee, they’ll come up with some wonderful reasons and put up a great argument. “Make them write it down,” he says.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"079e1f57-7609-4a70-ae66-889cb7f20fe5","text":"Ellison privately acknowledges that there may be some additional features that the engineering team needs to come up with. But he suspects that many of BellSouth’s difficulties are self-inflicted—not least the overspend—and are the result of using systems integrators to modify Oracle’s software: the big no-no. Rather than start an argument about what’s gone, however, he declares himself “thrilled that you want us to change the software rather than change it yourself; it’s the best way to add the features you need.” He adds that he shares de la Vega’s sense of urgency in getting in the new features: “It makes us more competitive as well as you. We want to be successful in the telecom industry, and that means we need to make you successful as well.” He then asks de la Vega if he’s ready to talk about changes to business processes to get the best out of the software. As long as BellSouth can be treated as a partner and involved in the process reengineering, de la Vega is ready to do anything that will get him to market more quickly. He says, “We agree, no customization, we’ve been through too much pain already.” The quid pro quo is that he must have Ellison—“the guy at the top”—prepared to stay involved. There’s been some friction with Oracle members of the project steering committee. Ellison confirms Oracle’s desire to make “a substantial investment in telco CRM” and promises that he will lead the development teams.5 There is still the little matter of horse trading over where the $20 million is going to be found that de la Vega needs to stay in budget. It’s kind of a challenge, says Nussbaum. De la Vega throws in an offer to be a customer reference. He suggests something along the lines of “We grew fastest, had the best customer satisfaction scores, and we did it with Oracle. I don’t mind telling the world that you guys fixed it.” Groves hints that the rest of BellSouth’s consumer business might also move to Oracle if the steering committee can come up with a really telcocentric version of the E-Business Suite. Finally, Ellison suggests that they are going to need more storage disks to mine all the data they will be collecting on customers and that he might be willing to “see if I can let you guys purchase disks off our special deal with EMC [the leading computer storage firm].” Whether it will all add up to $20 million is far from clear. But for the time being, everybody is happy and optimistic.

He argues that Oracle’s pricing should reflect the possibility that students introduced to the software at their university could become valuable customers in later life. Ellison says that Nussbaum has the authority to discount deeply but that what tends to cost most money in a software implementation is the labor to put it in, which can’t be discounted. “Our goal,” he says, “is to develop software that works out of the box, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money to change it. But to achieve that, we need a much closer relationship with our customers so that we fully understand their business processes. Then we can help you modernize those processes before we help you automate them. Don’t pay us or anyone else to adapt our software to the way you’ve been doing business for the last twenty years—if you do that, you’ll spend too much money and get too little benefit.” Ellison goes on to say that what he wants is to open up a debate about finding standard ways—best practices—of doing things across a number of institutions. That way automation of things like student record keeping becomes cheap and easy. “Okay,” says one of the presidents with the satisfied air of somebody who’s about to say something extremely smart, “but we’re going to want our own bells and whistles.” It’s as if he hasn’t heard a word that Ellison has been saying for the last forty-five minutes. Adroitly, Ellison turns the remark on its head. The question, he says, is whether those bells and whistles are innovations that will work for other universities and become best practice.

Suddenly, however, he has an idea. From what he heard today, he says, there’s a need to link an individual’s records from different academic institutions to create a single lifetime learning record to support accountability and validate credentials. Oracle could create such a database as a public service. “Up till now we’ve been focused on building software for individual universities. But we could build a national student record database and put it on the Internet. Every university could use the system for free. But don’t mistake this for altruism. If we create a free student record ‘hub’ database, it’s more likely that universities will purchase Oracle’s ‘spoke’ software.

It just has to fit with what else is there. And if you do a good job shaping your tile, it will be easier for the next person to fit his around yours.” “You’re saying that I’ve been looking for an answer when really I should be making one up?” He looked relieved. “Don’t believe the bull about science being only an objective search for truth. It’s not. Being a scientist also requires the skills of a politician. It’s a struggle to define the terms, to guide the debate, and persuade others to see things your way. If you’re the first one there”—again he pointed to the clock—“you get to say what it is that others will see.” As I drove back to my apartment, the answer to my problem came to me. When I got inside, I called Dr. Joshi and gave him a hasty review of my thinking. I could hear the sound of chalk against blackboard as he worked out the logic. After a long silence, he finally spoke. “Beautiful. Now all you have to do is write it up and get out of here. There’s nothing else I can teach you.” Surely, I thought, he was being funny—this was just his way of complimenting me on a good idea. “Come on, that’s not true at all!” I said. “I suppose there is one other thing.” He suddenly sounded more serious. “What’s that?” “Just remember that ideas last longer than people or things. Your ideas will go further if you don’t insist on going with them.” You know, he was not wrong.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"2af59a6d-545e-400d-8e47-ce4dbc890889","text":"I first met Mitchell Kapor in 1984, when he wandered into my office unannounced and asked what artificial intelligence might mean to personal computers. I was a logical person to ask, having completed my Ph.D. in the field five years earlier. After graduating from Penn in 1979, I joined the research staff of Stanford University. Stanford had the pace and style of a country club, with research grants blowing in through every open window. After slaving away for years on graduate studies and working every odd job I could find to support myself, I felt as if I had died and gone to heaven. It was a dream job, with virtually no responsibilities other than to think about something interesting and write up my ideas once in a while. In the absence of any objective measures of success, the tenured professors in the computer science department took to alternative means of establishing their self-worth, mainly by infighting and collecting academic titles. After about a year and a half of pastoral bliss, I concluded it was unhealthy to retire at the vital age of twenty-eight. Early in 1981, everyone in sight was starting companies. I was unexpectedly offered the opportunity to join a new artificial intelligence company called Teknowledge, formed by a group of Stanford professors. Teknowledge built expert systems, computer programs that used knowledge gleaned from human experts to reason through complex problems, like diagnosing obscure forms of cancer. Accustomed to the academic environment, the researchers did their work on large, symbolic computers called LISP machines, oblivious of the personal computer revolution taking place around them. The LISP machine was a classic boondoggle, built mainly under government grant and sold mainly to government research projects. An expensive, high-performance computer, the LISP machine was to the personal computer what an F-15 fighter jet was to a Cessna 150. About two years into this endeavor, I suspected that similar results could be obtained at far lower cost on a personal computer. So I commandeered an IBM PC and started to write programs in my spare time. Within a few months, I had a number of promising prototypes up and running. In a remarkable coincidence, this was precisely when Mitchell came to visit, asking his question.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"f5d702fd-b344-4445-930d-4f7c8c4ef8da","text":"Shuttling to Boston about once a month, I worked closely on the Lotus project with Mitchell and Ed.

This remarkable machine, the Compaq 286, packed all the power of the most recent generation of desktop personal computers into a box about the size and weight of a small sewing machine. The numeric designation 286 was not selected at random. It indicated that the product contained at its core a microprocessor chip called the 80286, designed and manufactured by Intel Corporation. In the mid-1980s, computer cognoscenti had a penchant for substituting technobabble for plain talk. This served a useful purpose. Learning to use a computer—much less to program one—required a level of personal commitment commensurate with learning the piano, and a similar level of innate talent. It attracted people who had difficulty with the messy business of human relations, preferring instead the company of predictable and infinitely patient machines. This devotion was rewarded with valuable skills and friendships.

It is like normal computer memory but requires much less power to keep the memory “alive,” and so places only a modest demand on a battery to retain its contents while the computer is turned off. “The interesting thing is, in principle you wouldn’t need to load and save files. You could just leave the programs running and the files loaded all the time.” Mitchell was getting into it now. In fact, we were both cooking. This was the fun part of the business, imagining possibilities. With technical breakthroughs announced every week—smaller disks that stored more data, faster microprocessors, denser memory chips—anyone could combine these parts and build a new product or create a new market. “But the problem is still the keyboard,” he said. “Not only that, it’s not always practical to type when you want to take a note.” I waved my hands in the air as though typing on an imaginary keyboard. “You have to set the computer down somewhere to free up your hands.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"e46ad342-0c66-4ac8-9893-868e2ddfb48e","text":"By the fall of 1981, a special breed of investor was scouring the Silicon Valley like a big league scout, searching for young entrepreneurs with promising ideas. These venture capitalists—usually called VCs—were known to put a million dollars on the table overnight for the right opportunity. It was a modern California gold rush. This overheated climate created a feeding frenzy around personal computers and software. Mitchell approached Ben Rosen, a former Wall Street analyst, and L. J. Sevin, a colorful Texan, with his idea. This unlikely pair had formed a partnership to grab a piece of the action, which they did with a vengeance. Rosen had used some of Mitchell’s software, and liked it. They cut him a check and went on to their next deal. Mitchell named his new company Lotus Development Corporation because of its countercultural, oxymoronic tone, like the name Apple Computer. Lotus was in a race with several more established competitors, and he knew it. Most industry people thought Lotus was crazy to try to unseat Visicalc, which dominated the market at that time. But Mitchell intuitively understood something that only the Japanese taught in school: in a fast-growing market, what matters is your share of new machines, not existing ones, because new machines quickly come to dominate the market.

In the 1960s, the popular image of a computer was a room full of mysterious, monolithic boxes the size of refrigerators, with spinning tapes and banks of flashing lights. These remote, intimidating mainframes were housed in special rooms with raised floors, filtered air, and glass walls which looked like an intensive care unit for electronics. With the advent of the minicomputer in the 1970s, the popular conception of a computer began to shift. These were smaller boxes that could be hidden in a closet or storeroom and connected to terminals sitting on the desks of engineers, bank tellers, and travel agents. In the 1980s, the personal computer took its place as the dominant form of computing. Now a computer was an individual productivity tool, consisting of a video screen sitting atop a rectangular box with a slot for floppy disks. This historical progression was not just about the physical look of the machines. With each wave of devices came whole communities of customers, operating systems, applications software, and companies. Subsequent generations didn’t supplant the previous ones; they empowered different people by solving different problems. Like some profound new form of energy, the underlying constant—computing power—had no shape or substance.

To my surprise, a spirited discussion ensued. When Mitchell had achieved an acceptable level of give and take between the participants, he steered the discussion to the core issues: equity, financing, and the nature of the project itself. It slowly emerged that each of us had a different agenda. He was interested in building a new company that would recapture the teamwork and momentum of the old Lotus without repeating the same mistakes. Peter was interested in designing an “object-oriented” computer interface that would knit together diverse documents, spreadsheets, and databases in a coherent, organic whole.

Specialized resources in the form of labor, raw and finished materials, capital, and knowledge come together in a marvelous process that transforms these components into goods and services of greater value. This miraculous conversion is similar to the process by which dirt, water, sunlight, and a packet of information in the form of a seed are reorganized into a living plant. Like plants, corporations are born, grow, and die, reach out for resources, fend off predators, and compete with others. Businesses evolve over time, as less efficient corporations are replaced by more effective ones, whose successful practices are then emulated by others. It is against this backdrop that the “startup game” developed. The startup game is an elaborate contest created to accelerate the pace at which corporations evolve, played continuously by an endless parade of hopeful entrepreneurs. It is a carnival game of life, testing the strength, aim, and skill of contestants willing to expose themselves, for glory or ridicule, to public scrutiny. The challenge is to find a new or better way to do business; the rewards are increased wealth, enhanced personal reputation, and control over one’s own destiny. The startup game is designed to motivate our brightest, most creative, and hardest-working individuals to improve the use of society’s resources, increase employment, and provide a broader range of quality goods and services. Here’s how the game is played. It begins with an aspiring entrepreneur who is willing to step right up and be tested. As in many other games, the player starts with an artificial currency—in this case, the stock of the new venture. The goal is simple: increase the value of the entrepreneur’s shares, because when the game is over, these can be cashed in for real money. The trick is to swap some of the stock for three resources—ideas, money, and people—then use these resources to increase the value of the remaining stock. The ideas are called intellectual property, which includes the business concept itself and any unique designs, processes, or plans for how to pursue the business. The intellectual property is safeguarded by trade-secret protection programs and by patents and copyrights. The money comes from investors, usually a venture capital partnership. The venture capitalists, or VCs, get a special form of equity called preferred stock. This stock confers certain rights, known as preferences, such as the right to appoint someone to the board of directors. People are usually assembled by recruiting friends and associates and by hiring headhunters to find them. These people become the employees, who are paid with a mixture of cash and stock. The cash is enough to cover reasonable living expenses, but is often less than the employees would earn at a stable, going concern. The stock is what they are really working for.

I decided to lead with the business issues. “Gentlemen, you probably think that there is no longer any way to make money by starting a new personal computer company. The competition is brutal, and the barriers to entry are high. However, I’m here to suggest to you the possibility that the PC as we know and love it may not be the best and final form that computers will take.

We will use them to take notes; send and receive messages through cellular telephone links; look up addresses, phone numbers, price lists, and inventories; do spreadsheet calculations; and fill out order forms. All of this can be done unobtrusively while sitting in meetings, conferring with clients, commuting to work on the train, or even when standing up and walking around. Like the fax machine, the pen computer can dramatically accelerate the pace and increase the efficiency at which business can be conducted. “I can’t say for sure when this will occur. But I do know that it will happen, and someone is going to make a big pile of money on it. With a little luck and some hard work, I think we could be the ones.

The VCs know that time is on their side: the less money a venture has, the more desperate it will be to make a deal. They stand on the sidelines with their hands in their pockets, like bystanders afraid to get involved, while small companies slowly bleed away their precious remaining cash. This is why frustrated entrepreneurs sometimes refer to VCs as vulture capitalists. The second and third rounds of financing are often the hardest. Although everyone involved would like to think that the process is rational, in practice it is as subjective as buying a house: it’s tough to pony up big bucks unless you are really fired up about something, and after all, who knows what it is really worth?

The human assistant is valued because he can,1 on his own, break a task down into its constituent parts, correctly anticipate next steps, and fill in missing details. The hope is that the computer will be able to do the same. An example of the computer-as-agent scenario is offered by Tesler in Scientific American (1991). He suggests that the computer will be able to respond to an instruction such as: “Distribute this draft to the rest of the group and let me know when they've read it.” Such a request involves considerable planning and coordination, but intelligent agents will be able to perform the appropriate actions because “programmers will … endow [agents] with … reasoning capabilities.” These capabilities are to be very sophisticated, including the ability to “anticipate needs before the user has expressed them or has even become aware of them.” The impending availability of computer assistants/agents amounts to nothing less than a “paradigm shift” in which the computer has changed from “cloistered oracle to personal implement to active assistant” (Tesler 1991).","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"c3995601-7fb4-45d2-a14e-72ea23ab0cde","text":"What interests me about these scenarios is not that they make fantastic, unrealistic promises (though I think they do), or that the instructions given by the user are couched in simple English (Tesler at least concedes that more structured languages may be needed), or that they embody such a grand vision (though the vision has much appeal). Rather, it is interesting that it is the programmer who is to control all of the computational magic. As Tesler says, programmers will endow computer-agents with their basic capabilities, even meeting such exciting challenges as programming the computer to know what users will think before they think it!

The richness derives directly from the ability of the children to program the computer. I am concerned that in our zeal to move on to the “next paradigm” we may be missing a tremendous opportunity to extend and deepen the current paradigm.

They created a meditation room in the attic crawl space above Elizabeth Holmes’s room and fixed it up with Indian prints, a dhurrie rug, candles, incense, and meditation cushions. “There was a hatch in the ceiling leading to an attic which had a huge amount of space,” Jobs said. “We took psychedelic drugs there sometimes, but mainly we just meditated.” Jobs’s engagement with Eastern spirituality, and especially Zen Buddhism, was not just some passing fancy or youthful dabbling. He embraced it with his typical intensity, and it became deeply ingrained in his personality. “Steve is very much Zen,” said Kottke. “It was a deep influence. You see it in his whole approach of stark, minimalist aesthetics, intense focus.” Jobs also became deeply influenced by the emphasis that Buddhism places on intuition. “I began to realize that an intuitive understanding and consciousness was more significant than abstract thinking and intellectual logical analysis,” he later said.

During the summer of 1973, he traveled to India to meet Ram Dass’s Hindu guru, Neem Karoli Baba, famously known to his many followers as Maharaj-ji. When he returned that fall, Friedland had taken a spiritual name and walked around in sandals and flowing Indian robes. He had a room off campus, above a garage, and Jobs would go there many afternoons to seek him out. He was entranced by the apparent intensity of Friedland’s conviction that a state of enlightenment truly existed and could be attained. “He turned me on to a different level of consciousness,” Jobs said. Friedland found Jobs fascinating as well. “He was always walking around barefoot,” he later told a reporter. “The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.” Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. “One of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.” According to Kottke, some of Jobs’s personality traits—including a few that lasted throughout his career—were borrowed from Friedland. “Friedland taught Steve the reality distortion field,” said Kottke. “He was charismatic and a bit of a con man and could bend situations to his very strong will. He was mercurial, sure of himself, a little dictatorial. Steve admired that, and he became more like that after spending time with Robert.” Jobs also absorbed how Friedland made himself the center of attention. “Robert was very much an outgoing, charismatic guy, a real salesman,” Kottke recalled. “When I first met Steve he was shy and self-effacing, a very private guy. I think Robert taught him a lot about selling, about coming out of his shell, of opening up and taking charge of a situation.” Friedland projected a high-wattage aura. “He would walk into a room and you would instantly notice him.

In all of his products, technology would be married to great design, elegance, human touches, and even romance. He would be in the fore of pushing friendly graphical user interfaces.

So I asked him to go on the night shift. It was a way to save him.” Jobs would come in after Lang and others had left and work through most of the night. Even thus isolated, he became known for his brashness. On those occasions when he happened to interact with others, he was prone to informing them that they were “dumb shits.” In retrospect, he stands by that judgment. “The only reason I shone was that everyone else was so bad,” Jobs recalled. Despite his arrogance (or perhaps because of it) he was able to charm Atari’s boss. “He was more philosophical than the other people I worked with,” Bushnell recalled. “We used to discuss free will versus determinism. I tended to believe that things were much more determined, that we were programmed. If we had perfect information, we could predict people’s actions. Steve felt the opposite.” That outlook accorded with his faith in the power of the will to bend reality. Jobs helped improve some of the games by pushing the chips to produce fun designs, and Bushnell’s inspiring willingness to play by his own rules rubbed off on him. In addition, he intuitively appreciated the simplicity of Atari’s games. They came with no manual and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman could figure them out. The only instructions for Atari’s Star Trek game were “1. Insert quarter. 2. Avoid Klingons.” Not all of his coworkers shunned Jobs. He became friends with Ron Wayne, a draftsman at Atari, who had earlier started a company that built slot machines. It subsequently failed, but Jobs became fascinated with the idea that it was possible to start your own company. “Ron was an amazing guy,” said Jobs. “He started companies. I had never met anybody like that.” He proposed to Wayne that they go into business together; Jobs said he could borrow $50,000, and they could design and market a slot machine. But Wayne had already been burned in business, so he declined. “I said that was the quickest way to lose $50,000,” Wayne recalled, “but I admired the fact that he had a burning drive to start his own business.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"ffdfb954-2f58-4c46-9198-1d3139e299be","text":"The Atari experience helped shape Jobs’s approach to business and design.

There was the technology revolution that began with the growth of military contractors and soon included electronics firms, microchip makers, video game designers, and computer companies. There was a hacker subculture—filled with wireheads, phreakers, cyberpunks, hobbyists, and just plain geeks—that included engineers who didn’t conform to the HP mold and their kids who weren’t attuned to the wavelengths of the subdivisions. There were quasi-academic groups doing studies on the effects of LSD; participants included Doug Engelbart of the Augmentation Research Center in Palo Alto, who later helped develop the computer mouse and graphical user interfaces, and Ken Kesey, who celebrated the drug with music-and-light shows featuring a house band that became the Grateful Dead. There was the hippie movement, born out of the Bay Area’s beat generation, and the rebellious political activists, born out of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. Overlaid on it all were various self-fulfillment movements pursuing paths to personal enlightenment: Zen and Hinduism, meditation and yoga, primal scream and sensory deprivation, Esalen and est. This fusion of flower power and processor power, enlightenment and technology, was embodied by Steve Jobs as he meditated in the mornings, audited physics classes at Stanford, worked nights at Atari, and dreamed of starting his own business. “There was just something going on here,” he said, looking back at the time and place. “The best music came from here—the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin—and so did the integrated circuit, and things like the Whole Earth Catalog.” Initially the technologists and the hippies did not interface well. Many in the counterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon and the power structure. In The Myth of the Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying “life-enhancing values.” An injunction on punch cards of the period—“Do not fold, spindle or mutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"df9dc7d2-088c-4307-b4bd-0029cfed3181","text":"But by the early 1970s a shift was under way. “Computing went from being dismissed as a tool of bureaucratic control to being embraced as a symbol of individual expression and liberation,” John Markoff wrote in his study of the counterculture’s convergence with the computer industry, What the Dormouse Said. It was an ethos lyrically expressed in Richard Brautigan’s 1967 poem, “All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace,” and the cyberdelic fusion was certified when Timothy Leary declared that personal computers had become the new LSD and years later revised his famous mantra to proclaim, “Turn on, boot up, jack in.” The musician Bono, who later became a friend of Jobs, often discussed with him why those immersed in the rock-drugs-rebel counterculture of the Bay Area ended up helping to create the personal computer industry. “The people who invented the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently,” he said. “The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking.

The foundation also helped launch the People’s Computer Company, which was not a company at all but a newsletter and organization with the motto “Computer power to the people.” There were occasional Wednesday-night potluck dinners, and two of the regulars, Gordon French and Fred Moore, decided to create a more formal club where news about personal electronics could be shared. They were energized by the arrival of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which had on its cover the first personal computer kit, the Altair. The Altair wasn’t much—just a $495 pile of parts that had to be soldered to a board that would then do little—but for hobbyists and hackers it heralded the dawn of a new era. Bill Gates and Paul Allen read the magazine and started working on a version of BASIC, an easy-to-use programming language, for the Altair. It also caught the attention of Jobs and Wozniak. And when an Altair kit arrived at the People’s Computer Company, it became the centerpiece for the first meeting of the club that French and Moore had decided to launch.

He had been designing a terminal, with a keyboard and monitor, that would connect to a distant minicomputer. Using a microprocessor, he could put some of the capacity of the minicomputer inside the terminal itself, so it could become a small stand-alone computer on a desktop. It was an enduring idea: keyboard, screen, and computer all in one integrated personal package. “This whole vision of a personal computer just popped into my head,” he said. “That night, I started to sketch out on paper what would later become known as the Apple I.” At first he planned to use the same microprocessor that was in the Altair, an Intel 8080. But each of those “cost almost more than my monthly rent,” so he looked for an alternative. He found one in the Motorola 6800, which a friend at HP was able to get for $40 apiece. Then he discovered a chip made by MOS Technologies that was electronically the same but cost only $20. It would make his machine affordable, but it would carry a long-term cost. Intel’s chips ended up becoming the industry standard, which would haunt Apple when its computers were incompatible with it. After work each day, Wozniak would go home for a TV dinner and then return to HP to moonlight on his computer. He spread out the parts in his cubicle, figured out their placement, and soldered them onto his motherboard. Then he began writing the software that would get the microprocessor to display images on the screen. Because he could not afford to pay for computer time, he wrote the code by hand. After a couple of months he was ready to test it. “I typed a few keys on the keyboard and I was shocked! The letters were displayed on the screen.” It was Sunday, June 29, 1975, a milestone for the personal computer. “It was the first time in history,” Wozniak later said, “anyone had typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer’s screen right in front of them.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"44faf58a-55de-4d7e-8341-4342439581be","text":"Jobs began to accompany Wozniak to Homebrew meetings, carrying the TV monitor and helping to set things up.

So he convinced Wozniak to stop giving away copies of his schematics. Most people didn’t have time to build it themselves anyway, Jobs argued. “Why don’t we build and sell printed circuit boards to them?” It was an example of their symbiosis. “Every time I’d design something great, Steve would find a way to make money for us,” said Wozniak. Wozniak admitted that he would have never thought of doing that on his own. “It never crossed my mind to sell computers. It was Steve who said, ‘Let’s hold them in the air and sell a few.’ ” Jobs worked out a plan to pay a guy he knew at Atari to draw the circuit boards and then print up fifty or so. That would cost about $1,000, plus the fee to the designer. They could sell them for $40 apiece and perhaps clear a profit of $700. Wozniak was dubious that they could sell them all. “I didn’t see how we would make our money back,” he recalled. He was already in trouble with his landlord for bouncing checks and now had to pay each month in cash. Jobs knew how to appeal to Wozniak. He didn’t argue that they were sure to make money, but instead that they would have a fun adventure. “Even if we lose our money, we’ll have a company,” said Jobs as they were driving in his Volkswagen bus. “For once in our lives, we’ll have a company.” This was enticing to Wozniak, even more than any prospect of getting rich. He recalled, “I was excited to think about us like that. To be two best friends starting a company. Wow. I knew right then that I’d do it. How could I not?” In order to raise the money they needed, Wozniak sold his HP 65 calculator for $500, though the buyer ended up stiffing him for half of that. For his part, Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus for $1,500. But the person who bought it came to find him two weeks later and said the engine had broken down, and Jobs agreed to pay for half of the repairs. Despite these little setbacks, they now had, with their own small savings thrown in, about $1,300 in working capital, the design for a product, and a plan.

Jobs had gone for another visit to the All One Farm, where he had been pruning the Gravenstein apple trees, and Wozniak picked him up at the airport. On the ride down to Los Altos, they bandied around options. They considered some typical tech words, such as Matrix, and some neologisms, such as Executek, and some straightforward boring names, like Personal Computers Inc. The deadline for deciding was the next day, when Jobs wanted to start filing the papers. Finally Jobs proposed Apple Computer. “I was on one of my fruitarian diets,” he explained. “I had just come back from the apple farm. It sounded fun, spirited, and not intimidating. Apple took the edge off the word ‘computer.’ Plus, it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book.” He told Wozniak that if a better name did not hit them by the next afternoon, they would just stick with Apple. And they did. Apple. It was a smart choice. The word instantly signaled friendliness and simplicity. It managed to be both slightly off-beat and as normal as a slice of pie. There was a whiff of counterculture, back-to-nature earthiness to it, yet nothing could be more American. And the two words together—Apple Computer—provided an amusing disjuncture. “It doesn’t quite make sense,” said Mike Markkula, who soon thereafter became the first chairman of the new company. “So it forces your brain to dwell on it.

Perhaps a better Wordsworth line would have been the poet’s description of those involved in the start of the French Revolution: “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive / But to be young was very heaven!” As Wozniak later exulted, “We were participating in the biggest revolution that had ever happened, I thought.

Jobs and friends were still making them by hand in his house, but the article referred to him as the director of marketing and “a former private consultant to Atari.” It made Apple sound like a real company. “Steve communicates with many of the computer clubs to keep his finger on the heartbeat of this young industry,” the article reported, and it quoted him explaining, “If we can rap about their needs, feelings and motivations, we can respond appropriately by giving them what they want.” By this time they had other competitors, in addition to the Altair, most notably the IMSAI 8080 and Processor Technology Corporation’s SOL-20. The latter was designed by Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French of the Homebrew Computer Club. They all had the chance to go on display during Labor Day weekend of 1976, at the first annual Personal Computer Festival, held in a tired hotel on the decaying boardwalk of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Jobs and Wozniak took a TWA flight to Philadelphia, cradling one cigar box with the Apple I and another with the prototype for the successor that Woz was working on. Sitting in the row behind them was Felsenstein, who looked at the Apple I and pronounced it “thoroughly unimpressive.” Wozniak was unnerved by the conversation in the row behind him. “We could hear them talking in advanced business talk,” he recalled, “using businesslike acronyms we’d never heard before.” Wozniak spent most of his time in their hotel room, tweaking his new prototype. He was too shy to stand at the card table that Apple had been assigned near the back of the exhibition hall. Daniel Kottke had taken the train down from Manhattan, where he was now attending Columbia, and he manned the table while Jobs walked the floor to inspect the competition. What he saw did not impress him. Wozniak, he felt reassured, was the best circuit engineer, and the Apple I (and surely its successor) could beat the competition in terms of functionality.

What Raskin didn’t know was that Jobs was working on a more complex deal. Xerox’s venture capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple financing during the summer of 1979. Jobs made an offer: “I will let you invest a million dollars in Apple if you will open the kimono at PARC.” Xerox accepted. It agreed to show Apple its new technology and in return got to buy 100,000 shares at about $10 each. By the time Apple went public a year later, Xerox’s $1 million worth of shares were worth $17.6 million. But Apple got the better end of the bargain. Jobs and his colleagues went to see Xerox PARC’s technology in December 1979 and, when Jobs realized he hadn’t been shown enough, got an even fuller demonstration a few days later. Larry Tesler was one of the Xerox scientists called upon to do the briefings, and he was thrilled to show off the work that his bosses back east had never seemed to appreciate. But the other briefer, Adele Goldberg, was appalled that her company seemed willing to give away its crown jewels. “It was incredibly stupid, completely nuts, and I fought to prevent giving Jobs much of anything,” she recalled. Goldberg got her way at the first briefing. Jobs, Raskin, and the Lisa team leader John Couch were ushered into the main lobby, where a Xerox Alto had been set up. “It was a very controlled show of a few applications, primarily a word-processing one,” Goldberg said. Jobs wasn’t satisfied, and he called Xerox headquarters demanding more. So he was invited back a few days later, and this time he brought a larger team that included Bill Atkinson and Bruce Horn, an Apple programmer who had worked at Xerox PARC. They both knew what to look for. “When I arrived at work, there was a lot of commotion, and I was told that Jobs and a bunch of his programmers were in the conference room,” said Goldberg. One of her engineers was trying to keep them entertained with more displays of the word-processing program. But Jobs was growing impatient. “Let’s stop this bullshit!” he kept shouting. So the Xerox folks huddled privately and decided to open the kimono a bit more, but only slowly. They agreed that Tesler could show off Smalltalk, the programming language, but he would demonstrate only what was known as the “unclassified” version. “It will dazzle [Jobs] and he’ll never know he didn’t get the confidential disclosure,” the head of the team told Goldberg.

He was speeding, and so were his mind and mouth. “This is it!” he shouted, emphasizing each word. “We’ve got to do it!” It was the breakthrough he had been looking for: bringing computers to the people, with the cheerful but affordable design of an Eichler home and the ease of use of a sleek kitchen appliance. “How long would this take to implement?” he asked. “I’m not sure,” Atkinson replied. “Maybe six months.” It was a wildly optimistic assessment, but also a motivating one.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"1e00464d-dfd5-4835-aebf-693dfe0ce8ff","text":"The improvements were in not just the details but the entire concept.

The Xerox system required you to select a command in order to do anything, ranging from resizing a window to changing the extension that located a file. The Apple system transformed the desktop metaphor into virtual reality by allowing you to directly touch, manipulate, drag, and relocate things. And Apple’s engineers worked in tandem with its designers—with Jobs spurring them on daily—to improve the desktop concept by adding delightful icons and menus that pulled down from a bar atop each window and the capability to open files and folders with a double click. It’s not as if Xerox executives ignored what their scientists had created at PARC. In fact they did try to capitalize on it, and in the process they showed why good execution is as important as good ideas. In 1981, well before the Apple Lisa or Macintosh, they introduced the Xerox Star, a machine that featured their graphical user interface, mouse, bitmapped display, windows, and desktop metaphor.

In his excitement, Jobs began to take over the daily management of the Lisa project, which was being run by John Couch, the former HP engineer.

One of Raskin’s dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in 1979 he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development project code-named “Annie” to do just that. Since Raskin thought it was sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as the Macintosh. Raskin envisioned a machine that would sell for $1,000 and be a simple appliance, with screen and keyboard and computer all in one unit. To keep the cost down, he proposed a tiny five-inch screen and a very cheap (and underpowered) microprocessor, the Motorola 6809. Raskin fancied himself a philosopher, and he wrote his thoughts in an ever-expanding notebook that he called “The Book of Macintosh.” He also issued occasional manifestos. One of these was called “Computers by the Millions,” and it began with an aspiration: “If personal computers are to be truly personal, it will have to be as likely as not that a family, picked at random, will own one.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"934351cb-68ed-4ad3-80a4-017a9672c65b","text":"The star of the team was a blond, cherubic, and psychologically intense self-taught young engineer named Burrell Smith, who worshipped the code work of Wozniak and tried to pull off similar dazzling feats.

At one point in the fall of 1979 Jobs told him instead to focus on building what he repeatedly called an “insanely great” product. “Don’t worry about price, just specify the computer’s abilities,” Jobs told him. Raskin responded with a sarcastic memo. It spelled out everything you would want in the proposed computer: a high-resolution color display, a printer that worked without a ribbon and could produce graphics in color at a page per second, unlimited access to the ARPA net, and the capability to recognize speech and synthesize music, “even simulate Caruso singing with the Mormon tabernacle choir, with variable reverberation.” The memo concluded, “Starting with the abilities desired is nonsense. We must start both with a price goal, and a set of abilities, and keep an eye on today’s and the immediate future’s technology.” In other words, Raskin had little patience for Jobs’s belief that you could distort reality if you had enough passion for your product. Thus they were destined to clash, especially after Jobs was ejected from the Lisa project in September 1980 and began casting around for someplace else to make his mark. It was inevitable that his gaze would fall on the Macintosh project. Raskin’s manifestos about an inexpensive machine for the masses, with a simple graphic interface and clean design, stirred his soul. And it was also inevitable that once Jobs set his sights on the Macintosh project, Raskin’s days were numbered. “Steve started acting on what he thought we should do, Jef started brooding, and it instantly was clear what the outcome would be,” recalled Joanna Hoffman, a member of the Mac team.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"2e3f055d-4bec-4e4f-882a-8c07b9b195ac","text":"Raskin’s former student Bill Atkinson sided with Jobs.

The world got a better result.” The disagreements were more than just philosophical; they became clashes of personality. “I think that he likes people to jump when he says jump,” Raskin once said. “I felt that he was untrustworthy, and that he does not take kindly to being found wanting. He doesn’t seem to like people who see him without a halo.” Jobs was equally dismissive of Raskin. “Jef was really pompous,” he said. “He didn’t know much about interfaces. So I decided to nab some of his people who were really good, like Atkinson, bring in some of my own, take the thing over and build a less expensive Lisa, not some piece of junk.” Some on the team found Jobs impossible to work with. “Jobs seems to introduce tension, politics, and hassles rather than enjoying a buffer from those distractions,” one engineer wrote in a memo to Raskin in December 1980. “I thoroughly enjoy talking with him, and I admire his ideas, practical perspective, and energy.

In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs decreed that henceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the Bicycle. This did not go over well. “Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped. By early 1981 the Mac team had grown to about twenty, and Jobs decided that they should have bigger quarters. So he moved everyone to the second floor of a brown-shingled, two-story building about three blocks from Apple’s main offices. It was next to a Texaco station and thus became known as Texaco Towers. In order to make the office more lively, he told the team to buy a stereo system. “Burrell and I ran out and bought a silver, cassette-based boom box right away, before he could change his mind,” recalled Hertzfeld.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"d65c6747-7218-4ccd-9dc7-c41740126b77","text":"He had the sense that he was special, a chosen one, an enlightened one. “He thinks there are a few people who are special—people like Einstein and Gandhi and the gurus he met in India—and he’s one of them,” said Hertzfeld. “He told Chrisann this.

It’s almost like Nietzsche.” Jobs never studied Nietzsche, but the philosopher’s concept of the will to power and the special nature of the Überman came naturally to him. As Nietzsche wrote in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, “The spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers the world.” If reality did not comport with his will, he would ignore it, as he had done with the birth of his daughter and would do years later, when first diagnosed with cancer.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"08e26290-0b6a-41f4-816f-150f2d655122","text":"The audacity of this pirouette technique would have dazzled Diaghilev. “If one line of argument failed to persuade, he would deftly switch to another,” Hertzfeld said. “Sometimes, he would throw you off balance by suddenly adopting your position as his own, without acknowledging that he ever thought differently.” That happened repeatedly to Bruce Horn, the programmer who, with Tesler, had been lured from Xerox PARC. “One week I’d tell him about an idea that I had, and he would say it was crazy,” recalled Horn. “The next week, he’d come and say, ‘Hey I have this great idea’—and it would be my idea! You’d call him on it and say, ‘Steve, I told you that a week ago,’ and he’d say, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah’ and just move right along.” It was as if Jobs’s brain circuits were missing a device that would modulate the extreme spikes of impulsive opinions that popped into his mind. So in dealing with him, the Mac team adopted an audio concept called a “low pass filter.” In processing his input, they learned to reduce the amplitude of his high-frequency signals. That served to smooth out the data set and provide a less jittery moving average of his evolving attitudes. “After a few cycles of him taking alternating extreme positions,” said Hertzfeld, “we would learn to low pass filter his signals and not react to the extremes.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"3c19db7b-292f-4f87-ac52-ea0f4c836adc","text":"Atkinson taught his team to put Jobs’s words through a translator. “We learned to interpret ‘This is shit’ to actually be a question that means, ‘Tell me why this is the best way to do it.’ ” But the story had a coda, which Atkinson also found instructive.

Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that if there were five million people using the Mac, and it took ten seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added up to three hundred million or so hours per year that people would save, which was the equivalent of at least one hundred lifetimes saved per year. “Larry was suitably impressed, and a few weeks later he came back and it booted up twenty-eight seconds faster,” Atkinson recalled. “Steve had a way of motivating by looking at the bigger picture.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"a15cd436-3e3b-4493-b716-b515aceac1a2","text":"“Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and he encouraged the design team to think of ourselves that way too,” said Hertzfeld. “The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money.

Even though he was German, Esslinger proposed that there should be a “born-in-America gene for Apple’s DNA” that would produce a “California global” look, inspired by “Hollywood and music, a bit of rebellion, and natural sex appeal.” His guiding principle was “Form follows emotion,” a play on the familiar maxim that form follows function. He produced forty models of products to demonstrate the concept, and when Jobs saw them he proclaimed, “Yes, this is it!” The Snow White look, which was adopted immediately for the Apple IIc, featured white cases, tight rounded curves, and lines of thin grooves for both ventilation and decoration.

It was a phenomenon that he would be able to replicate whenever there was a big product launch, from the Macintosh in 1984 to the iPad in 2010.

Afterward the magazine sent its technology columnist and a photographer to spend time in Palo Alto with Hertzfeld and Smith. The result was a flattering and smart four-page profile of the two of them, with pictures that made them look like cherubim of a new age.

Hertzfeld pulled off the remarkable feat of writing a music player in two days so that the computer could play the Chariots of Fire theme.

Gates’s father was a prominent Seattle lawyer, his mother a civic leader on a variety of prestigious boards. He became a tech geek at the area’s finest private school, Lakeside High, but he was never a rebel, hippie, spiritual seeker, or member of the counterculture. Instead of a Blue Box to rip off the phone company, Gates created for his school a program for scheduling classes, which helped him get into ones with the right girls, and a car-counting program for local traffic engineers. He went to Harvard, and when he decided to drop out it was not to find enlightenment with an Indian guru but to start a computer software company. Gates was good at computer coding, unlike Jobs, and his mind was more practical, disciplined, and abundant in analytic processing power. Jobs was more intuitive and romantic and had a greater instinct for making technology usable, design delightful, and interfaces friendly. He had a passion for perfection, which made him fiercely demanding, and he managed by charisma and scattershot intensity. Gates was more methodical; he held tightly scheduled product review meetings where he would cut to the heart of issues with lapidary skill. Both could be rude, but with Gates—who early in his career seemed to have a typical geek’s flirtation with the fringes of the Asperger’s scale—the cutting behavior tended to be less personal, based more on intellectual incisiveness than emotional callousness. Jobs would stare at people with a burning, wounding intensity; Gates sometimes had trouble making eye contact, but he was fundamentally humane. “Each one thought he was smarter than the other one, but Steve generally treated Bill as someone who was slightly inferior, especially in matters of taste and style,” said Andy Hertzfeld. “Bill looked down on Steve because he couldn’t actually program.” From the beginning of their relationship, Gates was fascinated by Jobs and slightly envious of his mesmerizing effect on people. But he also found him “fundamentally odd” and “weirdly flawed as a human being,” and he was put off by Jobs’s rudeness and his tendency to be “either in the mode of saying you were shit or trying to seduce you.” For his part, Jobs found Gates unnervingly narrow. “He’d be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger,” Jobs once declared. Their differences in personality and character would lead them to opposite sides of what would become the fundamental divide in the digital age.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"10dcfd80-e91f-4dab-8f5b-f76930d92cb3","text":"Gates saw Jobs’s reality distortion field at play when the Xerox Star was launched.

Jobs launched into a sermon about how the Macintosh and its software would be so easy to use that there would be no manuals. “It was like anybody who ever thought that there would be a manual for any Mac application was the greatest idiot,” said Gates. “And we were like, ‘Does he really mean it?

The artists Andy Warhol and Keith Haring were there, and they were so enthralled by what they could create with the machine that the contemporary art world almost took an ominous turn. “I drew a circle,” Warhol exclaimed proudly after using MacPaint. Warhol insisted that Jobs take a computer to Mick Jagger. When Jobs arrived at the rock star’s townhouse, Jagger seemed baffled. He didn’t quite know who Jobs was.

He was under contract to IBM, and his supervisors there said that it would obviously be a conflict for him to create a logo for another computer company. So Jobs picked up the phone and called IBM’s CEO, John Akers. Akers was out of town, but Jobs was so persistent that he was finally put through to Vice Chairman Paul Rizzo.

When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider, Rand declared that he did not create different options for clients. “I will solve your problem, and you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what I produce, or not, but I will not do options, and either way you will pay me.” Jobs admired that kind of thinking, so he made what was quite a gamble. The company would pay an astonishing $100,000 flat fee to get one design. “There was a clarity in our relationship,” Jobs said. “He had a purity as an artist, but he was astute at solving business problems. He had a tough exterior, and had perfected the image of a curmudgeon, but he was a teddy bear inside.” It was one of Jobs’s highest praises: purity as an artist.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"f2e08b09-781f-4184-9634-827a3dbeb15c","text":"Jobs decreed that the computer should be an absolutely perfect cube, with each side exactly a foot long and every angle precisely 90 degrees. He liked cubes. They had gravitas but also the slight whiff of a toy. But the NeXT cube was a Jobsian example of design desires trumping engineering considerations. The circuit boards, which fitted nicely into the traditional pizza-box shape, had to be reconfigured and stacked in order to nestle into a cube. Even worse, the perfection of the cube made it hard to manufacture. Most parts that are cast in molds have angles that are slightly greater than pure 90 degrees, so that it’s easier to get them out of the mold (just as it is easier to get a cake out of a pan that has angles slightly greater than 90 degrees). But Esslinger dictated, and Jobs enthusiastically agreed, that there would be no such “draft angles” that would ruin the purity and perfection of the cube. So the sides had to be produced separately, using molds that cost $650,000, at a specialty machine shop in Chicago. Jobs’s passion for perfection was out of control. When he noticed a tiny line in the chassis caused by the molds, something that any other computer maker would accept as unavoidable, he flew to Chicago and convinced the die caster to start over and do it perfectly. “Not a lot of die casters expect a celebrity to fly in,” noted one of the engineers. Jobs also had the company buy a $150,000 sanding machine to remove all lines where the mold faces met and insisted that the magnesium case be a matte black, which made it more susceptible to showing blemishes.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"e7ba92a4-a2eb-4095-8eb5-cb1de46be093","text":"In late 1986 Jobs sent out a proposal to venture capital firms offering a 10% stake in NeXT for $3 million.

She was revolted by the idea. “He was working himself up into a fervor of delight while I was shrinking into a rage and thinking, How could you defile music like that?” Jobs would confide in Debi Coleman and Joanna Hoffman about his relationship with Baez and worry about whether he could marry someone who had a teenage son and was probably past the point of wanting to have more children. “At times he would belittle her as being an ‘issues’ singer and not a true ‘political’ singer like Dylan,” said Hoffman. “She was a strong woman, and he wanted to show he was in control.

It came from a child in my son’s elementary school class. I had given school talks on being a scientist before, and I thought I knew what to expect. I never expected an eight-year old to stump me. I was talking about brains and how they work, and how human brains are different, and how this difference is reflected in our unique and complex mode of communication: language. But when I explained that only humans communicate with language, I struck a dissonant chord. “But don’t other animals have their own languages?” one child asked. This gave me the opportunity to outline some of the ways that language is special: how speech is far more rapid and precise than any other communication behavior, how the underlying rules for constructing sentences are so complicated and curious that it’s hard to explain how they could ever be learned, and how no other form of animal communication has the logical structure and open-ended possibilities that all languages have. But this wasn’t enough to satisfy a mind raised on Walt Disney animal stories. “Do animals just have SIMPLE languages?” my questioner continued. “No, apparently not,” I explained. “Although other animals communicate with one another, at least within the same species, this communication resembles language only in a very superficial way—for example, using sounds—but none that I know of has the equivalents of such things as words, much less nouns, verbs, and sentences. Not even simple ones.” “Why not?” asked another child. At this I hesitated. And the more I thought about it, the more I recognized that I didn’t really have an answer. As far as I could tell no other scientists had seriously considered the question in this form. Why are there no simple languages, with simple forms of nouns, verbs, and sentences? It is indeed a counterintuitive fact. Myths, fables, fairy tales, animated cartoons, and Disney movies portray what common sense suggests ought to be the case: that other animals with their simpler minds communicate and reason using simpler languages than ours.

We think differently from all other creatures on earth, and we can share those thoughts with one another in ways that no other species even approaches. In comparison, the rest of our biology is almost incidental. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution have produced hundreds of thousands of species with brains, and tens of thousands with complex behavioral, perceptual, and learning abilities. Only one of these has ever wondered about its place in the world, because only one evolved the ability to do so. Though we share the same earth with millions of kinds of living creatures, we also live in a world that no other species has access to. We inhabit a world full of abstractions, impossibilities, and paradoxes. We alone brood about what didn’t happen, and spend a large part of each day musing about the way things could have been if events had transpired differently. And we alone ponder what it will be like not to be. In what other species could individuals ever be troubled by the fact that they do not recall the way things were before they were born and will not know what will occur after they die? We tell stories about our real experiences and invent stories about imagined ones, and we even make use of these stories to organize our lives.

For decades, the superficiality of this stale dichotomy has been evident, exposed by research in the psychological and biological sciences that demonstrates how truly complex and interdependent the biological and environmental contributions to development can be; but we still find it difficult to conceive of these phenomena in other terms. We have reinvented the same old answers in new guises in each generation, stubbornly insisting that the answer to the question of language knowledge must be found in one of just a few major alternative paradigms (depicted in cartoon fashion in Figure 1.1). At one end of this spectrum is the assumption that the architecture of language originates entirely outside (simple associationism); at the other end is the assumption that it originates entirely inside (mentalese). What other alternatives could there be, that are not captured between these extremes? And if there are no other alternatives, then shouldn’t answering this question also point to the solution to the language origins question? Discovering which aspects of language knowledge are contributed by nature and which by nurture ought to tell us what difference in us was necessary to bridge the original language acquisition gap. If the answer lies more toward the associationist end of the spectrum, then evolution must have given us language by endowing us with exceptionally powerful learning and memory.

It seems to be an unstated assumption that if biological evolution continues long enough, some form of language will eventually evolve in many other species. Are chimpanzees the runners-up, lagging only a little behind on the road to language? As in Planet of the Apes, a science fiction movie in which our more hairy cousins catch up to a human level of mental and linguistic abilities, we imagine that if given sufficient time, something like language is prefigured in evolution. We even imagine that if there is life on other planets, and if it has been evolving as long as life on earth, or longer, there will be “intelligent” species with whom we may someday converse.1 The Renaissance notion of a “Great Chain of Being” gave rise to nineteenth-century theories of phylogeny that ranked species from lower to higher, from mechanism to godly, with humans just below angels. Though later nineteenth- and twentieth-century evolutionists rejected the static ranking of phylogeny and replaced it with the theory of evolutionary descent, the anthropocentric perspective was simply rephrased in evolutionary terms. Humans were presumably the most “advanced” species. Carrying this notion to its extreme, some people now suspect that there may be spaceships visiting earth, carrying beings that are “more highly evolved” than we are.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"e010d8b2-4345-430f-86e6-ea0b6f8559d8","text":"My point is not that we humans are better or smarter than other species, or that language is impossible for them. It is simply that these differences are not a matter of incommensurate kinds of language, but rather that these nonhuman forms of communication are something quite different from language. For this reason I think that the comparison is misguided, and useful only at a very superficial level. This fact should not be too difficult to appreciate because we all have personal experience of just the sort of incommensurability I am talking about. There are numerous human counterparts to other animals’ nonlinguistic communicative behaviors. We too have a wide range of innately produced and universally understood facial expressions, vocalizations, and gestures. As in other species, they are an irreplaceable component of human social communication. Yet this is not analogous to being bilingual. This other repertoire of communicative behaviors is not a language of gestures instead of words. It is something else. And although these human calls and gestures comprise an entirely familiar system, we find the same difficulty translating them into word equivalents as we do with animal calls and gestures with which we are far less familiar. The problem is not their unfamiliarity but rather that it simply makes no sense to ask what kind of word a laugh is, whether a sob is expressed in past or present tense, or if a sequence of facial gestures is correctly stated. The problem isn’t a difficulty mapping human to nonhuman languages, but rather a difficulty mapping languages to any other form of naturally evolved communication, human or otherwise.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"dfb6f0e8-9f28-4efd-b99b-7bae7c3b8b60","text":"A sophisticated robot is accidentally transformed from a mechanism that “just runs programs” into a conscious, self-aware being as a result of being struck by lightning. The power surge damaged its circuits in just the right way. The now conscious robot, of course, does not think of this as “damage.” From his perspective, the lightning bolt corrected a design limitation. As a cinematic device, the bolt of lightning accomplishes two important things. The catastrophic and unpredictable nature of lightning provides a vehicle for invoking drastic and unprecedented change, and its intrinsically chaotic—and, by tradition, miraculous—character obviates any possibility of describing exactly what alterations changed a computer mechanism into a human-type mind. For the sake of the story, we suspend critical analysis and allow this miraculous accident to stand in place of an otherwise inexplicable transformation. As an allegory of human mental evolution, it offers a paradigm example of what biologists call a “hopeful monster” theory: the evolutionary theorist’s counterpart to divine intervention, in which a freak mutation just happens to produce a radically different and serendipitously better-equipped organism.5 The single most influential “hopeful monster” theory of human language evolution was offered by the linguist Noam Chomsky, and has since been echoed by numerous linguists, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists. Chomsky argued that the ability of children to acquire the grammar of their first language, and the ability of adults effortlessly to use this grammar, can only be explained if we assume that all grammars are variations of a single generic “Universal Grammar,” and that all human brains come with a built-in language organ that contains this language blueprint.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"}],"finished":null,"finished_at":null},{"id":"6deec2cc900f000e","title":"The Perception Machine: Our Photographic Future between the Eye and AI","author":"Joanna Zylinska","sources":["kindle"],"highlights":[{"id":"541b60c6-24f7-4788-b920-3ce8696be733","text":"Importantly, and in line with the widespread retention of this term in computation, the imaging industry, and, last but not least, its social use, my working definition of photography—even if applied to images whose method of production exceeds pure “writing with light” to embrace calculation and selection—is itself both residual and experiential.

Almost anything you say about it, no matter how true, may also be misleading. Having said that, here’s a place to start: you can think of enlightenment as a kind of permanent shift in perspective that comes about through direct realization that there is no thing called “self” inside you. This is a very rough and ready definition. We might call it the “executive summary.” Notice that I’m not saying that there is no self, but rather no thing called a self. Of course, there is certainly an activity inside you called personality, an activity of the self. But that is different from a thing called the self. Meditation changes your relationship to sensory experience, including your thoughts and body sensations. It allows you to experience thoughts and body sensations in a clear and unblocked way. When the sensory experience of the mind-body becomes sufficiently clear and uninhibited, it ceases to be a rigid thing that imprisons your identity. The sensory self becomes a comfortable home, not a jail cell. That’s why enlightenment is sometimes referred to as liberation. You realize that the thingness of self is an artifact caused by habitual nebulosity and viscosity around your mind-body experience. Confusingly, the experience of no self can also be described as the experience of true self or deepest soul. You can call it no self, true self, big self, elastic self, liberation, nature, or true love—you can call it whatever you want. The important thing is not so much what you call it but to know why it’s relevant to your life and how you can feasibly get there.

But I also worried. “These are people,” I thought as I copied the numbers and sent them off, “and we can’t even track about 15 of them.” My job was to scale the operation, which involved technology, of course, but also the people—these people!—who were building it.

In early 2013, Chris Urmson, its head, gave me a call to ask if I would consider joining the group to help run the business and product side. I had no experience building hardware, I didn’t have a background in machine learning, and I didn’t know much about cars. But Chris kept pushing, and it became clear to me that there was something I could bring to the table. The group was filled with brilliant engineers whose lunch conversations sounded like they were straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the team also needed to manage supply chains, perform complex operational testing, coordinate across teams building hardware and software, run planning processes, and motivate team members. Plus, they had to work with Google’s leadership to set the vision for both the team and the ultimate business that might emerge from what was then primarily an R & D project. In short, what Chris needed was an experienced operator and manager—a COO, in today’s parlance. I joined the team and spent the next 10 months setting up the structures, teams, and direction to help move Google’s self-driving division forward. Unfortunately, this story does not end with all of us zipping around in our own autonomous, AI-powered vehicles, but that’s a tale for another book. This experience did, however, underscore two important lessons for me. First, I got the job because I had built a reputation as a great manager, and being a great manager can be a significant career differentiator. Second, no matter how brilliant a company is, it will not get far, let alone have an impact at scale, without strong management and sound operating systems—what you might call core processes. Over time, my experience made me a person many founders consult on the combination of these two elements. A few years ago, I was giving a talk at a 40-person startup. During the Q & A, someone asked what processes I thought the company should put in place. My answer was “I’m not going to tell you which processes you should put in place. But I will tell you that you need them, and you need them sooner than you realize.” When the person asked why, I said, “You know why playing a game is fun? Because it has rules, and you have a way to win. Picture a bunch of people showing up at an athletic field with random equipment and no rules. Someone is going to get hurt. You don’t know how to play, you don’t know how to score, and you don’t know how to win.” It’s critical for companies and teams to establish the playing field on which everyone participates and marks progress.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"0af93d3f-f9be-4baf-9aff-f42003f18e7c","text":"When I joined Gmail, I inherited a talented associate manager as a direct report.

Making those elements clear to everyone allows a group of people to become a true team and a company to scale. Perhaps because of those abilities, and certainly due to Google’s success, in the second half of my career there I wound up on a kind of underground list of COO candidates for growth-stage startups. I came quite close several times to leaving for such a role, but each time it felt more like I was running away from frustrations at Google after a long tenure than like I was running toward the right opportunity for my combination of skills, mission orientation, and desire to find the mix of founders and business model that I felt could match or exceed the very high impact bar Google had had in its first decade.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"81cd03b1-da59-418f-9d43-1ef0a1cd83bb","text":"People often ask me what surprised me when I joined Stripe.

When we sent out our first StripeSat—our internal employee engagement survey—in May 2015, satisfaction with team-level management was among our lowest-scoring areas. We had promoted a lot of people into management internally, which is an effective way to reward high performers and build company scaffolding, but we hadn’t invested enough in giving people the resources and the support they needed to be the most effective managers they could be. After that, we worked hard to help managers improve their skills. Just a few years later, satisfaction with team-level management became one of the top three highest-scoring categories on the survey. It’s stayed in that position ever since. When you hire senior leaders into a young company, they can have a disproportionate impact, positive or negative, on your organization. (This book aims for the positive!) I would venture that one of my most positive impacts was my strong belief in good management.

The second is the “associative” phase, in which the person becomes more efficient and makes fewer errors. The last is the “autonomous” phase, in which they complete the task reasonably well without thinking about it. The typists were all plateauing in this last phase, unable to make further progress. Building on this work years later, psychology professors K. Anders Ericsson and Nina Keith conducted a study of intermediate-level typists in which they found that the ones who improved the most were those who dedicated themselves to a frequent practice of typing quickly.3 I first read about this insight in Joshua Foer’s book Moonwalking with Einstein, where it serves as a supporting story for Foer’s own work with Ericsson to improve his memorization skills.4 He recounts that Ericsson advised him to buy a metronome and then set it 10–20 percent faster than his current memorization limit. This led to more errors, but Ericsson advised him to forge ahead. Soon enough, Foer had pushed through the memorization plateau he had hit. Additional research has found that people who outperform in their fields employ strategies that move them past the autonomous stage of learning, like athletes who use speed workouts to improve their performance.5 In other words, to make a break-through performance improvement during the autonomous stage, you need to set an uncomfortable pace for yourself.

But what if one seeks a book to set out principles that explain how our brain, while being far smarter than a supercomputer, can also be far smaller and cheaper? Then the shelf is bare. One reason is that modern neuroscience has been “technique driven.” Whereas in the 1960s most experiments that one might conceive were technically impossible, now with methods such as patch clamping, two-photon microscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), aided by molecular biology, the situation has reversed, and it is harder to conceive of an experiment that cannot be done. Consequently, the idea of pausing to distill principles from facts has lacked appeal. Moreover, to many who ferret out great new facts for a living, it has seemed like a waste of time.

The fact that a baby’s biological, neurological and rhythmical needs are merging with Baby’s natural capacities, means nothing is hindering the upward progress toward comprehensive attachment. “Comprehensive” refers to the total spectrum of growth and development as measured by an infant’s attainment of his or her developmental capacities. The infant who fails to attain these basic capacities will be deprived of a healthy relational attachment. Here’s why. Infants are born with seven capacities, that when met, provide objective markers that comprehensive attachment is being achieved. These markers include babies who 1) synchronize their feed-week-sleep cycles into predictable patterns; 2) can fall asleep without a rocking or nursing prop; 3) sleep through the night eight to ten consecutive hours; 4) have a predictable nap routine; 5) have content wake-times and are adapt to self-play; 6) are able to self-soothe; 7) are comfortable with a variety of care-givers (fathers, siblings, grandparents). These indicators confirm Baby is not stressed or anxious. These are attachment markers. In contrast, Attachment Anxiety is marked by the twelve, eighteen month, or two year old, who is not sleeping through the night, not taking regular naps, unable to self-soothe, is anxious when left alone, or not adapt at self play for sustained periods.

I could see that trattorias in Rome distinguished themselves by nuances: how each chef cooked a classic dish.

It’s hard not to fall in love with a society that is confident about and content with its traditions, so that it doesn’t need to eat a different kind of food every day at lunch and every evening at dinner.

I loved art and went to the Museum of Modern Art as often as possible taking advantage of my grandfather’s annual gift to me of a membership there. By attending opening parties at the museum, I also learned that New York’s social life consisted of more than Upper East Side bars. The joy I was experiencing each day by setting my own personal and professional agenda made it increasingly clear to me that I would never go to work for someone else. Even at Checkpoint, where I officially reported to sales directors, I worked for myself out of my own walk-up apartment on the East Side. I had built my own little business within a business, creating my own schedule, plotting my own tactics, and exceeding whatever goals were set for me. My dad and both of my grandfathers had worked for themselves, and they were all presidents of their companies. My mother had owned her own art gallery. I had an uncontainable drive to win that was now in high gear. What I loved most about Checkpoint was that my hard work and independence provided financial rewards and opportunities for seeking my own pleasure. I was devouring New York. I could take myself on little adventures all over town, and I loved being able to eat out and learn. I’d map out an entire day of sales calls, basing my schedule on where to eat in whatever borough I had to visit that day. It could be a Greek diner in Astoria, a Jewish deli, or Popeye’s Fried Chicken in Brooklyn, or even an Olive Garden in Peekskill (that was the best restaurant in Peekskill at the time). By night I’d dine, following the advice of the New York Times’s restaurant critic Mimi Sheraton, or, better still, making a sport of discovering new places on my own. I was still taking opportunities to travel to Europe (now flying for $149 each way on People Express) so that I could explore food. I took one seventeen-day road trip with two close friends—Connor Seabrook and Zander Grant—driving from Paris to Rome and back. The itinerary had to do exclusively with finding great places to eat. This gastronomic adventure had been largely designed for us by my father, and it felt good to reconnect over something he was so good at. The dollar was very strong, enabling three ravenous young men to eat abundantly and well for modest prices. I loved finding good value in places off the beaten path; in fact, I was uninterested in dining at the most expensive places.

I chose not to drink wine because the test was being given early in the morning. I told my uncle, “I can’t believe I’m doing this LSAT thing tomorrow. I don’t even want to be a lawyer.” “So why are you?” Richard Polsky asked in an exasperated tone. “You know you don’t want to be a lawyer.

His high school friend, Steve Jobs, had the foresight to see that there might be a consumer market for such a machine, and so they went on to found Apple Computer in 1976. The second account locates the birthplace of personal computing at Xerox’s fabled Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s. There, the giant copier company assembled a group of the nation’s best computer scientists and gave them enough freedom to conceive of information tools for the office of the future. Out of that remarkable collection of talent came a computer called the Alto, the forerunner of today’s desktops and portables. Although Xerox is reputed to have “fumbled the future” by not commercializing the device successfully, the dozens of spin-offs that resulted from PARC became the basis for one of Silicon Valley’s most oft-told fables: that in 1979 Jobs visited PARC and took away with him the idea of the graphical user interface.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"37fe4154-e472-495c-adca-a3b72e902b4f","text":"This book is about what came before, about the extraordinary convergence of politics, culture, and technology that took place in a period of less than two decades and within the space of just a few square miles.

Of course, none of that was apparent from what was nothing more than an invitation to attend a lecture being given by Harry Rathbun, a professor of business law at Stanford. Rathbun was a charismatic teacher who was tremendously popular on campus, where he lectured to overflow classes on subjects that included discussions of personal ethics and values. Rathbun’s presentation was given in a small library in South Palo Alto, and it struck Stolaroff “between the eyes.”14 The themes the law professor addressed that evening included “Who are we?” and “Where are we going?” They were Big Questions About Life. Stolaroff was transported, realizing that his life had been hollow and that the questions Rathbun was asking and answering mesmerized him. It was the first in a series of five lectures Rathbun delivered in Palo Alto in the early 1950s.

Perhaps not surprisingly, it was at the Rathbuns’ retreat that Stolaroff, the Jewish engineer, had his first mystical experience.

It was generally understood around the lab that Engelbart was simply putting in time at SRI in order to help pay the bills, as his real interest lay in building digital computers. Initially, the idea failed to captivate English. It was still very much an analog world, and he quickly learned that Engelbart was an inveterate dreamer. What set Engelbart apart was that he was persistent enough to get money for his wild ideas. The first funding had come in the form of the small grant that Charlie Rosen had helped him get from the air force’s Office of Scientific Research. That was a trickle, but eventually SRI pitched in some support from general funds to contribute $120,000 between 1960 and 1965.1 During the first two years of his contract, Doug Engelbart largely ruminated about his dream machine. He wrote several draft versions of papers exploring what he had come to call the concept of the “man-machine interface.” Historically, machines had only handled materials or generated power, but now, by adding information, it became possible to control their actions by programming them. For the first time, it was possible to consider using computers as something other than mere calculators. Engelbart’s ideas stressed interaction between a machine and its user, an idea that was unheard-of at the time. As he wrote, the “computer world should see similar evolution. We are in the phase now of big machines, formally scheduled, but we will pass soon into new applications where a human directs the movement and manipulation of information under continuous control as he pursues his occupational goals.” Then he added these prophetic words: “Let’s be sure that our concept of the man-machine interface problem doesn’t get stuck on the big-installation, formal-scheduling picture.

His first official position at the laboratory was building an electronic circuit called a shift register to convert parallel data to serial data, for the small one-handed keyboard that English was testing.

The screen that had been rigged to work with the minicomputer that would serve as a test machine was set into a frame that sat on the computer desktop, and looked very much like the round screens that are still used today by air-traffic controllers.

The number was a disappointment to Engelbart, who was passionate about the need for a complex control device. Using it would require training, he argued, but once the user mastered the contraption it would give him far more power over the system. In his mind it was like the scaling lesson of the pencil tied to the brick. The conflict between ease of use and expert power was one that would plague the inventor throughout his life and years later lead him to say that he had failed in his mission. Eventually, ease versus power became a divisive issue in the computing world. It was an example of a range of issues where he was both ahead and slightly out of touch with the reality of the world that surrounded him. Engelbart had a complete vision, but as he evolved it, his best ideas were cherry-picked by others and used to create one of the world’s most vibrant industries.

It is easy to understand why Engelbart would find the idea of enhancing creativity with psychedelic drugs so intriguing. After all, the aims of the early LSD community closely paralleled his own passionate quest to augment human intelligence. Drug-induced creativity was not part of his original vision, but if it would make a difference it certainly might be a welcome addition to the process, which he referred to as bootstrapping: working in an iterative fashion in which each improvement would in turn accelerate the pursuit of further advances. In a way, bootstrapping was simply a restatement of the concept of exponential change, in this case applied to a human organization. The results of Engelbart’s own psychedelic-drug experience, however, proved disappointing. His first LSD session was with a group and was held under Jim Fadiman’s guidance. Engelbart was given a “modest” dose of twenty-five micrograms and then spent four hours meditating, listening to music, and relaxing. The night before the experiment, each of the subjects in the creativity study went through an extensive psychological preparation aimed at infusing them with the idea that under the influence of the drug they would be able to solve their problems, for the premise underlying the experiments was to motivate a group of people who had spent at least three months working on a difficult technical or creative issue and were not making progress. The problems were supposed to be ones the scientists had a high emotional need to solve. After lunch, and after the LSD had taken effect, they would be put to work, while the researchers observed. In the group setting, everyone was making progress.

Previously, the CDC minicomputers that the Augment project had been using were single-user systems of limited interactivity. They now referred to them as FLS (for oFf Line System) and began work on a new version of NLS. The FLS required loading a paper tape and from the terminal typing a series of commands. It was then possible to load a second tape, and the computer would edit the document for you according to the commands you had typed in. It was a remarkably cumbersome process. It is impossible to overestimate the significance of the role that the revised NLS played in the development of personal computing. In 1968, Doug Engelbart started “living” in the future. A display was installed in his office that was connected to a jury-rigged video system that ultimately made it possible to harness as many as ten similar television monitors simultaneously to the SDS-940. Because the cost of the existing computer-display monitors available during the 1960s was astronomically high, Engelbart’s hardware designers had to figure out a less expensive alternative for displaying black text on a white screen. What they arrived at was a kluge—an inelegant but clever solution. Because of the prohibitive cost of computer memory and large cathode-ray tubes, the researchers set up an array of five-inch high-resolution monitors. A video camera was then pointed at each one, with the space between each monitor and camera shrouded so that the camera signal could be carried clearly to a remote, larger, and relatively less expensive television screen that functioned as a desktop display. It took one-and-a-half full-time technicians just to keep the system functioning, but it made it possible to create individual video workstations that could display both text and graphics, for roughly around five thousand dollars—inexpensive at the time. It also made it possible for several monitors to share the same information display, paving the way for work-group computing. In the new NLS system, each workstation consisted of a keyboard for entering data and alongside it a mouse with three buttons and a five-key keyboard. The small keyboard, which looked a bit like a short piano without sharps and flats, could be used either for entering text or for sending commands to the system, making it possible to edit rapidly with two hands without being forced to move a hand between the keyboard and mouse.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"a7fcd3eb-c8c2-4a18-9da4-0c507abdb0bf","text":"Much of the breadth of Engelbart’s original Augmentation Framework idea would be lost until the early 1990s, when the commercial computing world finally discovered the power of the Internet.

Before arriving at Stanford in 1962, McCarthy had already made several towering contributions to the world of computing. He had invented the LISP programming language, a highly flexible tool that during the sixties became the standard for artificial-intelligence researchers, and he had pioneered the modern time-shared operating systems that would become the foundation of interactive computing. McCarthy had been born a “Red-Diaper Baby” in Boston in 1927, with both his parents active in the Communist Party. His father, John Patrick McCarthy, was an Irish immigrant who later became business manager of the Communist Party organ The Daily Worker after the family moved to Los Angeles because of their young son’s health problems. His mother, Ida Glatt, was a Lithuanian Jew who had been active in the women’s suffrage movement. Young McCarthy, when he moved to Princeton to study mathematics in graduate school in 1949, joined the local party cell, which consisted of two other members: an elderly African-American woman who cleaned homes and an Italian immigrant who worked as a gardener. Such was the Red Menace. He watched the Moscow show trials of the early fifties, hoping that the abuses of the Soviets would moderate. In the end, because he had left home, he was able to quit the party without being embarrassed or embarrassing his family. At Princeton, McCarthy was a contemporary of John Nash, who later won a Nobel Prize in economics for his work in game theory, and whose life was chronicled by Sylvia Nasar in A Beautiful Mind. As graduate students, McCarthy, Nash, and several of the other students enjoyed constantly scheming and playing practical jokes on one another, justifying their antics in terms of their game-theory explorations. McCarthy arrived at Stanford for the second time (he had taught math there briefly in the early fifties) as a thirty-five-year-old former wunderkind who had invented the term “artificial intelligence.” While teaching math at Dartmouth during the summer of 1956, he had been the principal organizer of the first conference on modeling intelligence in computers and coined the term as part of the conference proposal. At the time, he was working on a chess-playing computer program, and throughout his career he remained an optimist regarding the possibility of creating intelligent machines. However, after the heady period of the sixties and seventies, when it seemed that thinking machines were truly within reach, he adopted a healthy respect for the challenge, saying that creating artificial intelligence would require “1.8 Einsteins and one tenth the resources of the Manhattan Project.”","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"77b5d40e-9cb1-4ee8-b14f-11225c3461ec","text":"A time of open scientific and technical experimentation, the period 1963 to 1969 was considered the “golden years” of AI. Rapid progress was made in a range of areas, including vision, robotics, expert systems, speech, and language understanding. The AI world was then largely split into two camps. One group believed that it would be feasible to successfully model the neural functions of the human brain, making it possible to synthesize human capabilities like vision and speech. A competing view was held by a group who thought that it was conceivable to build a “superbrain” and that AI machines could exceed human capabilities. From the very beginning, McCarthy believed that artificial intelligence should be interactive with the user, but he never dreamed of having his own machine. Instead, computers had become fast enough so that by slicing the computer’s programming resources into tiny time slots and allocating them to different users, each user would have the illusion that he had a single large computer all to himself. Since computers did things at lightning speed, and since in the days before graphical displays most user interaction with the machine consisted of merely entering text and data at a keyboard, the vast majority of the computer’s time was being wasted while it waited for user input. To be sure, there had been an earlier time-sharing machine invented at the RAND Corporation known as JOSS, but it consisted of lights on top of terminals—the computer’s time was allocated to the terminal whose light was switched on at the moment! In the late 1950s, however, McCarthy’s notion was prescient and similar to Doug Engelbart’s vision for the Augmentation machine. However, they remained fundamentally different concepts. At the deepest level, the question was whether humans would remain in the loop. Brilliant machines that could both mimic and surpass human capabilities were not what Engelbart foresaw, and although the two camps didn’t directly quarrel they did pursue opposite agendas, representing humanist and mechanist ideas about the future of computing and technology. Yet ultimately, despite the fact that they were philosophical opponents, together the work of the Augmentation laboratory at SRI and the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory came to define a vision for “personal computing,” predating the personal computer itself.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"020a8497-16e8-47c6-8922-c6a46836ef11","text":"When inexpensive personal computers finally came on the scene a decade later in the mid-1970s, they were viewed in opposition to time-sharing minicomputers.

In many ways, Russell was the quintessential hacker. Although he had never been to California before, he thought nothing of picking up and following McCarthy cross-country. In many respects, he didn’t even notice the change of coasts, for his existence still revolved around the care and feeding of a Digital PDP-1 computer. A science fiction fan, with a small group of other MIT hackers he had also programmed the world’s first video game in 1961 and 1962.4 Russell and his friends had something very ambitious in mind. They were all devotees of the E. E. “Doc” Smith “Lensman” pulp science fiction novels, a series of shoot-’em-up space operas that seemed the perfect model for an interactive software game. Russell, who was a bit of a procrastinator, had put off writing the foundation code, pleading that he didn’t have a necessary subroutine and that he didn’t know how to write it. That excuse was undone after another MIT hacker, Alan Kotok, traveled all the way to Digital Equipment Corporation’s headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, to obtain the necessary code, stored on a paper tape. He gave Russell the programs and told him, “All right, Russell, here’s a sine-cosine routine; now what’s your excuse?”5 By January 1962, Russell had a rudimentary object-in-motion worked out on the screen. Spacewar, as the game came to be called, pitted two two-dimensional spaceships against each other on a background of stars. Pressing keys on the keyboard would move the ships on the display, and they could shoot tiny projectiles at each other. Spacewar was significant in that it was the classic collaborative hacking exercise, which would be cited as an early example of how open-source shared programs could be continuously improved by a group of volunteer programmers. For although Russell did the initial yeoman’s work of creating the basic program, others had soon added lifelike constellations and a gravitational effect generated by a star placed in the center of the screen. Initially, the PDP-1 had enough power to compute the gravitational effect on the ships accurately but not enough to compute the trajectories of multiple torpedoes. The hackers defined away that problem by decreeing the projectiles were actually “photon” torpedoes and were thus beyond the gravitational pull of the star.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"88029fd6-eea3-41fd-8f76-096922f76355","text":"Dozens of the world’s best computer scientists began their careers at SAIL.

He had initially been exposed to electronic music while studying in Paris, where he attended live performances by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez. He arrived at Stanford as a graduate student in music in 1962, never having had any contact with computers. Chowning had already been intrigued by the idea of using loudspeakers as instruments, but nothing would have come of his interest had he not met Dave Poole in the Stanford student orchestra; Poole was also one of the young computer hackers hanging around SAIL. Poole handed him a Science magazine article written by Max Matthews, a Bell Laboratories researcher. The article speculated that the computer would soon emerge as the ultimate musical instrument, and it made the bold statement that in theory you might produce any perceivable sound with one. Knowing nothing about computers, Chowning traveled to visit Matthews and returned to campus with a deck of punch cards containing a program that Matthews had designed. Although Poole, who was still an undergraduate, was ten years Chowning’s junior, he took him under his wing and introduced him to the world of computing. The classic hacker, he frequently became impatient and shouted at Chowning when he was slow to pick up some idea that Poole deemed obvious. Eventually, however, the hacker came to understand that the musician’s background had not equipped him for the rapid acquisition of knowledge, and a great deal of affection grew between the two men. In 1967, Chowning made his breakthrough while experimenting with vibratos in an effort to add realism to electronic sounds. He had been playing with a pair of oscillators, modulating one sine wave with the output of another. The result was a richly harmonic tone from which he could approximate the sound of clarinets, bassoons, and similar instruments, and the discovery became known as frequency modulation synthesis. Four years later, he handed the technology to Stanford’s Office of Technology Licensing, which in turn approached a number of American instrument makers. None of them was interested, and it was Yamaha that ultimately licensed Chowning’s invention.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"fe676638-82f6-4a8c-9b47-4a832c5130a0","text":"Ken Colby, a Stanford computer scientist and psychiatrist who had worked with Joseph Weizenbaum, who would later become a well-known MIT computer scientist, on his Eliza conversational program, brought his research group to the laboratory early on.

Turing identified a simple way of cutting through the philosophical debate about whether a machine could ever be built to mimic the human mind. If, in a blind test, a person could not tell whether he was communicating with a computer or a human, Turing reasoned, the question would be resolved. Weizenbaum had developed the Eliza program to explore the Turing problem, but it was Colby who wrote the machine’s responses, which simulated a Rogerian psychiatrist, a program that responds to statements with questions. Colby was interested in producing a scientific theory of psychiatry instead of relying on Freud’s “revealed religion.” He had worked on a program called the Mad Doctor. His goal was to help psychiatrists work with their patients. He knew that in large mental hospitals at that time, there would frequently be a single professional available for five hundred or more patients, which meant there was almost no professional contact or help for many of them. It occurred to him that by creating a simulation he might be able to provide mental patients meaningful and helpful interactions.16 Once he was at SAIL, Colby began working on Parry, an interactive AI program that duplicated the behavior of a paranoid personality. The program ultimately became far more powerful than Eliza, which had begun with a limited set of fifty interactive patterns.

One of the alternative school’s veterans was a researcher at the Stanford Medical Center, and he suggested that Warren come over and take a job as a computer programmer. Computers were increasingly being used in data collection and analysis in the medical school’s research projects. It was perfect: Programmers were paid relatively well, and the hours were notoriously flexible. There was just one small problem. His experience writing software was limited to a prehistoric IBM computer he had programmed in assembly language. “No problem,” the researcher assured him. “You’ll pick it up.” And Warren did. He was handed the manuals for a Digital PDP-8, a minicomputer that had eight kilobytes of memory and a magnetic-tape storage system. At the time, PDP-8s were flooding into the Bay Area, where they were being used for industrial process control. One of the first Free U regulars Warren met was Larry Tesler, who had closed down his independent programming business and taken a job at SAIL. By now, the Free University was speaking to a growing movement of people who were frustrated with the mainstream university system, which seemed to be increasingly in the thrall of the military-industrial complex. Thousands were attracted to the idea of education beyond the walls of the traditional classroom, and both Tesler and Warren became committed participants, with Warren serving at one point as chairman and Tesler as treasurer. In the evenings, the two frequently worked at the Free University store on El Camino Real, producing the Free University newspaper in the back room with one of the ubiquitous IBM Selectric typewriters. The machines, with their distinctive bouncing ball, were not just the gold standard for the corporate office world. Used Selectrics were highly prized by community and political groups because they made it possible to inexpensively produce reasonably acceptable-appearing pamphlets, newspapers, and propaganda. With scissors, X-Acto knives, and pots of glue, the two men painstakingly produced the Free U literature. One evening, Tesler grew frustrated with the slow pace of the work, turned to Warren, and said, “You know, Jim, this is really ridiculous. We have these big computer monitors at the AI lab, and we could really just display these pages up on the screen, and you could just cut and paste right in the screen, and we wouldn’t have to do this stuff anymore.” Warren thought that this was a great idea and, after pondering the suggestion for a moment, asked, “Well, how would you get it onto paper after that?” That stopped Tesler’s reverie. “I haven’t figured that out yet,” he replied.

As his business took off, he began getting other jobs from the Valley’s start-up companies. Then, in late 1967 there was a recession, and his business collapsed as people stopped using consultants. He decided to take a job at one of his clients, SAIL. So in early 1968, he began making the trek out to the D. C. Power building to work as a research programmer. At first, he was enthralled with the esoteric world of machines that one day might think. He was programming in the area of natural-language understanding—a basic technology that would be required for voice recognition and other AI applications, as well as for cognitive modeling, which was supposed to help the AI researchers move toward a better understanding of how the human mind worked. During the next two years, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with the disappointing pace of the field. All around him he could see that the computer industry was exploding, but little progress was being made toward reaching even the primitive goals that the community had hoped would be achievable in the early sixties. For a while, he tried to convince the Stanford computer-science department to create a computer-graphics program, but he ran into resistance; the professors didn’t think there were any significant applications for graphics. Moreover, while John McCarthy, Les Earnest, and many of the other researchers at SAIL remained deep believers in the idea of time-shared computing, Tesler soon grew skeptical. It seems there is an unwritten law of the computing universe that no matter how powerful a computer is, software will soon be developed that will bring the machine to its knees. At SAIL, where the situation was compounded by the elegant system that farmed the central computer out to as many as sixty-four simultaneous users, performance was a constant issue. As a result, Tesler and other researchers were forced to sit around for hours waiting for their jobs to run. He began to complain that life had been better in the era of batch computing when researchers had submitted decks of cards to be run one at a time on a mainframe computer. Perhaps because of his early experience with the LINC in Lederberg’s office, being forced to share the system rankled Tesler, and he began to think about the possibility of a personal computer, although not by that name. Finally, in 1969, he decided to do something about it. With Horace Enea, a graduate student at SAIL who was also working for Ken Colby, the psychiatrist, Tesler set out to design a small computer.

He reeled off a series of programming tasks needed to make the SAIL computer system more useful. Tesler seized on the idea of creating a new language to make it possible to print high-quality documents. He remembered his late-night conversation with Jim Warren, and it seemed like a perfect task to help bring an end to the era of glue pots and scissors. Earnest showed him a program that already existed called Runoff, a primitive piece of software that supported basic commands such as “.indent” and “.nextpage” and “.center,” but Earnest envisioned something far more powerful. He had been thinking about Chinese character sets, variable fonts, and computer-driven typesetting. That kind of software didn’t exist, so Tesler set out to do a better version of Runoff, creating a programming language for printing that would allow the creation of documents with footnotes, tables of contents, underlining, page numbering, and all the controls necessary to publish the highest-quality documents. He wrote a language called PUB—the cover of the manual for the program was embellished with an engraving of an old British pub—that was a great success. In many respects, it foreshadowed HTML—the markup language that would come to define the World Wide Web and make Internet publishing possible—in that it was the first language to use a feature known as “embedded tags.” At the time, the typesetting industry was independently developing similar languages, but they were all specific to a particular machine. Tesler’s was the first general-purpose programming language that would do typesetting for any type of device. While PUB was finding a devoted band of users, Tesler decided he had had enough of AI research. The Whole Earth Catalog was having a growing influence on the nascent counterculture, and thousands of people in their twenties were leaving the cities and striking out to create a back-to-the-land communal existence. Tesler found a small group of like-minded friends, one of whom, Francine Slate, had been an employee of the Whole Earth Catalog, and together they decided to buy farmland.

C. Power building, in the Stanford Industrial Park. During 1970, Kay had begun helping with the process of talent spotting, and he thought Tesler would be a good match for the new laboratory, which was supposed to develop the digital office of the future. Tesler’s friend Horace Enea told Kay that Tesler had just left to go live on a commune. It was almost three years before Tesler and Kay were to rendezvous at PARC, where the personal computer would flower during the early 1970s. However, well before PARC, the idea of personal computing was already beginning to have an impact on SAIL. It became a hotly debated subject in the late 1960s, as some of the SAIL hackers began to absorb the consequences of Moore’s Law. Early on, one faction at the lab had decided the computer of the future would be like an automobile—something that would be used as needed, and then would sit idle. The idea made no sense to SAIL’s founders, McCarthy and Earnest. Why would you want to give up all of the power that was embedded in their shared community resource? Why would you want to go off and attempt to reinvent what already worked so well? Several years later, a testy John McCarthy would use the phrase “Xerox Heresies” to describe the one worker–one computer ideology that was being promulgated just over the hill at the PARC laboratory. It is hardly surprising that the man who was the father of modern computer time-sharing—an idea that made virtual “personal computing” a reality—would find the idea of breaking up the computer into thousands of less powerful machines to be folly. Indeed, the hallmark of each generation of computing has been that its practitioners have resisted each subsequent shift in technology. Mainframes, minicomputers, PCs, PDAs—at the outset of each innovation, the old guard has fought a pitched battle against the upstarts, only to give in to the brutal realities of cost and performance.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"ede71134-bff8-4473-9cb8-ddb5a7028a76","text":"McCarthy’s belief, which was presented in the form of an academic paper prepared for an international conference in Bordeaux, France, in 1970, was that within a half a decade homes would be equipped with information terminals “each consisting of a typewriter keyboard and a screen capable of displaying one or more pages of print and pictures.”5 He foresaw that the terminal would be connected via the telephone network to a time-shared computer, which in turn would store files that would contain all books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs, airline schedules, public information, and personal files. McCarthy had in effect sketched the outlines of the World Wide Web, which did not become a reality until 1995. At the time, he saw two main advantages and two disadvantages to his notion of home computing: First, it would be possible for anyone to get any document imaginable instantly; and, second, homes would no longer fill up with paper, which meant that trees would be saved and air pollution would be minimized. He also speculated that such a new electronic information system might make it possible to circumvent the homogeneous propaganda that was a consequence of the centralized mass media of the television era.

The discussion did, however, have consequences. One day while he was thinking about the challenges of such a system, McCarthy had a chance conversation with one of the SAIL researchers, a young computer hacker named Whitfield Diffie. Diffie had read McCarthy’s Bordeaux paper and asked an obvious question about the paperless world that McCarthy envisioned: What would take the place of a signature in an all-electronic world? It was a question that was to consume Diffie during the next five years and ultimately lead to his pioneering work on digital signatures and public-key cryptography. His research, with Stanford professor Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle, a Stanford graduate student, ultimately paved the way to both privacy in the electronic world and the security needed for the commercial services made available by the World Wide Web. Public-key cryptography not only allowed the secure transmission of digital information between parties who would never meet face-to-face, it also answered Diffie’s original question by making possible digital signatures. It laid the basis for trust and authentication in cyberspace. A native New Yorker and a math prodigy, Diffie had had McCarthy as a professor in 1962 while he was an undergraduate at MIT and then came to work for him at SAIL in 1969 to help tackle a challenging software and math problem known as “proof of correctness.” Mathematicians believed that it was theoretically possible to prove formally that a software program had no bugs—or was correct—and McCarthy had Pentagon funding to do research in the field. Diffie was one of a legion of bright young men who, were it not for the Vietnam War, would probably not have considered the idea of military-funded basic research. But it seemed like a reasonable compromise when facing the equally dismal alternatives of being shipped to Indochina, fleeing to Canada, or going to jail.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"d5a3a08f-fd7c-4169-959e-2c9222481dfe","text":"While Diffie was passing through SAIL, another software designer passed through the laboratory nurturing the idea of the personal computer.

He acknowledged that he had come to see how beautiful John McCarthy’s LISP programming language was.6 And he was briefly immersed in the world of artificial intelligence, which was then pushing at the edges of computer science. He submerged himself in several of the deductive-logic systems that were being developed by research scientists who were attempting to build abstract planning and reasoning systems, and he dabbled with the idea of developing languages that could be extrapolated from them.

Enjoying the mountain climate in Boulder, he concluded that wherever he went to school should be above four thousand feet. Boulder didn’t have a Ph.D. computer-science program, and his fantasy of going to Wisconsin to study philosophy didn’t pan out, so he ended up at the University of Utah, with literally only a dime in his pocket. Kay arrived on campus a little before the beginning of the winter quarter, and he had the good fortune of finding computer scientist David Evans as a mentor. Evans was then in his mid-forties, although he looked as if he was about twenty-five. At the time, Kay, like almost everyone else he knew, dressed in the obligatory engineer’s uniform of white dress shirt and slacks. When he met Evans, the professor was wearing an informal polo shirt. It was a month before classes were scheduled to start, and Evans asked Kay, If he could do anything he wanted, what he would like to do? “Well, I’ve never read the literature,” Kay replied. “So if I had my druthers I would just go to the library and read everything that’s been written since the mid-fifties, and I’d Xerox all the interesting things.”9 Evans said that would be fine, gave Kay a photocopying budget, and turned him loose. The new graduate student spent his days in the library reading every technical article he could find in the Association for Computing Machinery journals and all the articles that were published in the fall and spring issues of Joint Technical Meetings. And every time he found an interesting one, he copied it for his files. In addition to Evans, Kay also came into contact with the work of Ivan Sutherland. The University of Utah was then the nation’s leading center of computer-graphics research. (Evans and Sutherland would found a pioneering computer graphics company nearby in 1968.) Among Kay’s readings was Sutherland’s doctoral dissertation: “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System.” Sketchpad had been a striking advance at the time that computers were still thought of as ponderous calculators. It was a drawing program in which the user controlled a light pen to create pictures, blueprints, or architectural drawings. The program made it possible to edit, copy, or transform a line image in many ways that were impossible with pencil, paper, and eraser. Evans was handing out the thesis to all comers and told Kay, “Take this and read it.”10","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"a6b80d50-ff6b-408f-a048-31d0eab79290","text":"It fell to Kay to get a version of the Algol programming language running on a Univac mainframe computer. He arrived at his desk to find that someone had placed a magnetic computer tape on it with a note that said, “This is Algol for the 1108. It doesn’t work. Make it work.” When Kay began to explore the problem, he found that the tape actually contained a Norwegian programming language called Simula. To make matters worse, all of its documentation had been written in Norwegian and then translated one word at a time into English. Frequently, he found the terms that were being used to describe things had actually been made up. It also turned out that some of the terms had different meanings than their English computing counterparts. Painstakingly, with several other graduate students, Kay engaged in the Talmudic exercise of deconstructing the machine code found on the tape. The engineering building at the University of Utah had extremely long corridors, and the students laid the listing of the program out on the floor over more than eighty feet, mulling over it to attempt to understand what the language was doing. Kay was struggling with a portion of the programming language known as the “storage allocator,” and as he probed the arcane rows of numbers he could see that it pointed to other sections of code, forcing him to jump back and forth along the corridor in an almost physical demonstration of hypertext. Previously, Kay had not fully understood what Sutherland had been doing inside his Sketchpad program to make it a powerful drawing tool, but as he looked at the Simula listing lying on the floor he realized that the two programs shared a basic approach. The insight came to him on November 11, 1966, when he saw that both programs were attempting to create something that was akin to a biological cell mechanism in which simple building blocks are used to create complex systems. As the comprehension dawned on him, he became more and more excited. Traditionally, computer programs have been divided into data structures and procedures. This was an inherently weaker approach to the design of a computation system, he decided. Now he had stumbled across an entirely new way of looking at computation in which all the components are modular, mimicking the cellular structure of living systems. Moreover, it was an idea that was intrinsically parallel—each module could be a complete independent computer. That realization led to another crucial insight. What both Simula and Sketchpad were missing, Kay realized, was another fundamental component of basic cellular mechanisms: the ability to communicate using messages. In January, Evans arranged a consulting job for Kay working with a brilliant computer hardware designer named Ed Cheadle. Cheadle was developing a small desktop computer that was intended to help with his engineering calculations.

Suddenly, he was certain there would soon be not thousands but millions of computer users. He likened the feeling to the kind of queasiness that those who read Copernicus must have felt when he looked up at the sky after he realized that the sun did not circle around the earth.11 It was not a coincidence that the two men who had the greatest impact on the shape of today’s personal computer were among the earliest to fully comprehend the impact of the exponential scaling of microelectronic circuits.

Local newspaper articles that preceded the conference noted that there would be discussions of the privacy implications of the use of computers, and a public forum, “Information, Computers and the Political Process,” would feature broadcaster Edward P. Morgan and Santa Clara County’s member of the House of Representatives, Paul McCloskey Jr. But Engelbart stole the show. In the days afterward, the published accounts of the event described nothing else. Years later, his talk remained “the mother of all demos,” in the words of Andries van Dam, a Brown University computer scientist. In many ways, it is still the most remarkable computer-technology demonstration of all time. “Fantastic World of Tomorrow’s Computer” was the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle, which noted that Engelbart had said that his group was consciously steering clear of any artificial “brain” or thinking computer.

It was easy for Engelbart to wave his hands and conceptualize his computing vision, but someone had to build the demonstration from scratch. And that someone was English. An absolute pragmatist, he had an uncanny knack for making things work. English was the one who had tracked down the remarkable Eidaphor video projector for the demonstration. On loan from NASA, and with the blessing of Bob Taylor at ARPA, the Eidaphor was the only technology that could create the kind of effect that Engelbart had in mind. It was a six-foot-high cabinet that used a blindingly intense arc light, bouncing it off a concave mirror to make a bright, 875-line video projection. The fact that the device drew each frame by forming an image with an electron beam in a sheet of oil that was repeatedly wiped away by a windshield wiper made the feat only more remarkable. Engelbart had hesitantly gone to Taylor with the idea in the summer, and the ARPA official had given his blessing to the extravaganza. Later, when the researcher told one of SRI’s accountants that he had ARPA’s blessing for the huge expense, he had been told that it was okay to go ahead, but if the venture failed, SRI planned to deny any knowledge of its approval. From his platform behind the audience, English served as the link between Engelbart onstage and the laboratory researchers who were connected from Menlo Park to the auditorium by two video microwave links and two modem lines. English served as the director, talking by telephone to Menlo Park and by a communication link to a speaker in Engelbart’s ear, cuing each part of the demonstration and controlling the camera views. The researchers had placed a truck at a strategic point on Skyline Boulevard, high above the Peninsula, to relay the microwave links to the city, and they had built two homebrew high-speed modems—1200 baud was high speed in 1968, and each modem carried data in only a single direction—to connect Engelbart’s keyboard, mouse, and key set to the SDS-940 in Menlo Park. It required a complicated choreography to mix the images from the display screen, a camera that was pointed at Engelbart’s keyboard, and a second camera in Menlo Park to show demonstrations by members of the laboratory research team. At times it seemed to the audience that Engelbart wasn’t quite there, that he was listening to some distant voice. And, in fact, he was. He could hear English talking to all of the participants up and down the Peninsula, which made for constantly distracting background chatter.

English and Brand had met through Dick Raymond, who along with a quirky independent computer educator named Bob Albrecht and several others had founded the Portola Institute, an alternative educational forum that served as the launching pad for the Whole Earth Catalog, the People’s Computer Company, and a variety of other experiments. Raymond had been a consultant in the field of recreational economics at SRI, and Brand had been a longtime friend of the Raymond family, dating back to his days as a Stanford student.

Raymond thought they needed a photographer, and he prevailed on Brand to take pictures. Visiting the reservation had a profound effect on the would-be photojournalist, who stumbled upon a part of America that was remarkably alien to his comfortable middle-class Midwestern roots. That visit had come shortly after his LSD experience at the International Foundation for Advanced Study in 1962, and as a result of his time spent on the reservation Brand had developed a deep interest in Native American cultures.

Eventually, it would expand to satisfy Bob Taylor’s concept of a single network that would permit information sharing and remote computing among a diverse community of computer users. Meetings had begun the previous summer between representatives from the four initial sites, and they continued into the fall. After the March 1969 meeting, Steve Crocker, a member of the UCLA group, had drawn up a preliminary set of notes he referred to as “Request for Comments 1.” Such RFCs would become a rich Internet tradition and a simple and efficient way to produce technical standards for the network. The first RFC was based on the group’s discussions and outlined a set of understandings about how the host computers at the four sites would communicate through intermediate data processors known as IMPs, which had been developed for the new network at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge. There was something even more revealing about RFC 1, which was essentially the founding document of what was to become the modern Internet. At the end of the paper, Crocker outlined two “experiments.” The first called for SRI to modify its NLS software so that it could be operated remotely by teletypes. All of the sites would then use NLS remotely. The second experiment was even more ambitious. SRI was instructed to write a more ambitious “front end” for the complete version of NLS, one that would include graphics. “UCLA and Utah will use NLS with graphics,” the report concluded. There it was, buried in the paper that was to launch a computer network that would stretch around the globe and tie together people in fundamentally new ways. Doug Engelbart’s NLS tool was intended to be the first “killer app.” The term would become popular a decade later. It referred to a software application that would drive a new wave of growth in the computing industry.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"2cbab6d2-7a66-4d07-8a59-36e11ae5c1a2","text":"Separately, the two men became the world’s first telecommuters.

Duvall agreed as a condition of his relocation to program a simple version of the software that would enable him to work remotely via a telephone line. From his cabin in the rolling California hills, Andrews became one of the first people to exploit the power of the ARPAnet. The Augment project was in the process of moving from its SDS-940 computer to a more modern Digital PDP-10, and Andrews needed some way to test the programs he was writing on the newer computer before it arrived at SRI. It proved to be an ideal opportunity to test the fledgling network. There was a PDP-10 at the University of Utah, and so Andrews transferred his program file from Menlo Park to Utah and then ran it remotely, all from a log cabin in the backwoods of northern California.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"06b2b05d-777b-4a49-ba55-d27a8ae77817","text":"Now that the network finally existed, it should have been the crowning glory of Engelbart’s system for augmenting the human intellect. NLS should have become the original killer app. It wasn’t. The limited bandwidth of the new network, coupled with the intricacies of using NLS, conspired against Engelbart’s vision of spreading his system to knowledge workers around the world. For all its power, the NLS system’s lack of a welcoming audience beyond SRI was ultimately Engelbart’s greatest failure. For those who mastered its complexities, NLS offered editing, retrieval, and communications capabilities that in many ways have not been matched today. But the system was not easy to learn, it required training and a significant personal commitment, and its availability via the ARPAnet did not draw a flood of users. Responding to the pressure from ARPA to use some of the resources of their new network, John McCarthy at SAIL attempted to use NLS by entering one of his research papers into the system. The experience was a disappointing one. McCarthy recoiled at the hierarchical structure that NLS impressed upon its users. The system, he discovered, forced each document to be broken into chunks of no greater size than one thousand characters and to be in an outline structure. The process was so laborious that when he finished he decided that he had no interest in going through the process again, whatever the benefits. McCarthy came to view both Engelbart’s and Ted Nelson’s ideas on text editing and hypertext as too dictatorial. He decided structure was imposing an unnecessary restriction on his thought process. The structure imposed by NLS, which researchers like McCarthy detested, coupled with the training required to become an expert user and the limited network bandwidth that forced network users to use the more awkward remote version of NLS, ultimately became the system’s downfall. Moreover, not long after the 1968 demonstration, even while the project continued to grow in numbers, a steady brain drain began taking place from the Augment lab.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"6fe73520-92d3-4adf-8fa1-2f64b68a04f8","text":"The occupiers voted to leave the AEL building only after Stanford promised to end classified research on campus. However, the university still had a direct relationship to SRI. The following month, on May 16, a pitched battle was fought in the streets of the Stanford Industrial Park as more than five hundred students attempted to blockade SRI’s offices there. Tear gas was used, sixteen demonstrators were arrested, and ninety warrants were issued based on photos taken by right-wing students. The next day, students marched on SRI’s Menlo Park headquarters. Inside Doug Engelbart’s group, there was a brief attempt to use the new NLS as part of a command center in case the demonstrators tried to storm the buildings. But the protests were peaceful compared to those in the industrial park. While demonstrators outside the gates of SRI had made an impact on many of the researchers inside, others remained more or less unmoved. Bill Duvall was so deeply involved in the innards of NLS that he barely noticed. He was sitting at his terminal programming when someone said, “The demonstrators are outside.” He briefly got up and went to the window and looked out and then returned to his work. But for others, the presence of the demonstrators created an agonizing time of reassessment. When Hew Crane, Engelbart’s coworker from the 1950s, learned of an SRI management plan to ring the perimeter of the labs with a barbed-wire fence, he wrote a letter to the director of security, warning him about what kind of a message that would send. For David Casseres, the demonstrators’ appearance carried with it a stronger message. He realized that he was on the wrong side of the picket line. He had previously gone to the several antiwar marches in Berkeley. Now feelings that had been swirling inside him for a long time were brought to a sharp focus, and not long afterward he decided it was time to leave. He quit and joined a Gandhian commune in Oregon that called its farm Ithilien, a name taken from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.","note":null,"location":{"chapter":null,"position":null},"created_at":null,"source":"kindle"},{"id":"6d7f6f95-699a-40ee-9af4-2d7b3a8e8796","text":"The Vietnam war, drugs, sexual liberation, women’s liberation, the Black Panthers, the human-potential movement, the back-to-the-land movement—at the end of the 1960s, all of these were concentrating with wicked force on the San Francisco Peninsula. And in the midst of the chaos, Doug Engelbart felt that he was beginning to lose control of his vision, the Augmentation Framework. Everything seemed to be in dispute, even the name of the laboratory, which had for several years been the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center (AHIRC). Although it expressed Englebart’s vision precisely, it seemed top-heavy to many of his young researchers. At his low “yoga” workstation, Bill Duvall began flying what amounted to a pirate flag by displaying an abbreviated ARC, for Augmentation Research Center. Finally, after much debate Engelbart agreed to the name change. Thereafter, he was occasionally referred to affectionately as Noah. Nonetheless, it was an increasingly painful time for Engelbart, who felt isolated as he was pushed and pulled about by his team. He felt that everyone wanted to go in different directions, and nobody was willing to talk to him in terms of his beloved framework. The programmers met separately, the women met separately, and things increasingly seemed to be beyond his control. Years later, he referred to the period as the “beginning of the end” and recalled the pain it gave rise to. He began to feel increasingly lonely and isolated. In trying to build the organization, Engelbart had found that he didn’t understand how to make it scale up while remaining focused on his mission. It was a little bit like giving your teenager the keys to the car for the first time and finding that she has immediately taken it to the beach. He felt a growing sense of frustration as his carefully nurtured group struggled to seize control of his system. Things began unraveling just as the Augment lab was going through its period of fastest growth. ARC went from being a band of gypsies to a real organization with an actual organizational structure. Engelbart was looking for help in containing his obstreperous work group and felt hammered by people who thought that ARC should be run differently. Frustrated that he could not convey his vision to his researchers, Engelbart sought out Jim Fadiman, the young psychologist who had studied the effects of LSD in graduate school at Stanford and who had worked at Myron Stolaroff’s International Foundation for Advanced Study. Engelbart had met him three years earlier when he had experimented with psychedelics, and now he renewed his connection. For more than a year, Fadiman served as a consultant for the researchers, who came to refer to him as the “group shrink.” Coming in just one or two days a week, he attempted to sort out the group dynamics with an informal “walk around” approach to observing the workings of the lab.

This is the thin end of the wedge: If Manfred is right, it could catalyze a whole new wave of communist expansion, driven by humanitarian ideals and demonstrably superior performance, rather than wishful thinking and ideology. “It is impossible, I fear. This is Italy, my friend. Everybody has to have their say. Not everybody even understands what it is we are talking about, but that won’t stop them talking about it. Since 1945, our government requires consensus—a reaction to what came before. Do you know we have five different routes to putting forward a new law, two of them added as emergency measures to break the gridlock? And none of them work on their own unless you can get everybody to agree. Your plan is daring and radical, but if it works, we must understand why we work—and that digs right to the root of being human, and not everybody will agree.” At this point Manfred realizes that he’s lost. “I don’t understand,” he says, genuinely puzzled. “What has the human condition got to do with economics?” The minister sighs abruptly. “You are very unusual. You earn no money, do you? But you are rich, because grateful people who have benefited from your work give you everything you need. You are like a medieval troubadour who has found favor with the aristocracy. Your labor is not alienated—it is given freely, and your means of production is with you always, inside your head.” Manfred blinks; the jargon is weirdly technical-sounding but orthogonal to his experience, offering him a disquieting glimpse into the world of the terminally future-shocked. He is surprised to find that not understanding itches. Gianni taps his balding temple with a knuckle like a walnut. “Most people spend little time inside their heads.

A pet-breeding program?” Pamela asks coldly. She’s run up against Aineko’s implanted limits, too, Manfred realizes with a growing sense of horror. Did we really split up because Aineko made us?
