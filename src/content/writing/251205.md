description: Building a system to publish blog posts by sending text messages
---

I've been thinking about friction lately. The friction between having a thought and sharing it. The friction between seeing something interesting and capturing it. The friction between living and documenting.

Most of my favorite writers maintain some kind of informal stream alongside their longer work — a place for quick observations, half-formed ideas, interesting things they've encountered. Twitter used to serve this purpose for many people. Now it doesn't.

I wanted something simpler. I wanted to text my blog.

The ideal scenario in my head: a phone number I could message from any device. Send it a photo with a caption, and it shows up on my site. Send it a quick thought while waiting in line, published. No apps to open, no markdown to write, no git commits to make. Just texting.

I started where most people would start: Twilio. Get a phone number, set up a webhook, receive SMS, publish to the site. Simple enough architecture:

```
Phone → SMS → Twilio → Webhook → GitHub → Deploy
```

Then I actually tried to get a phone number from Twilio.

Twilio has become a regulatory maze. Toll-free numbers require "verification" — a multi-day approval process involving business documentation. Local numbers need "A2P 10DLC registration" — another approval process. Every path forward had a 24-48 hour waiting period attached to it.

I just wanted to text my blog.

After an hour of navigating Twilio's compliance labyrinth, I stepped back. The phone number dream was romantic, but the implementation reality was bureaucratic. There had to be another way.

~

Telegram. Free. No verification. No approval process. Bots are first-class citizens. I could have something working in minutes instead of days.

The architecture shifted:

```
Telegram App → Bot → Cloudflare Worker → GitHub → Deploy
                           ↓
                     Cloudflare R2 (images)
```

A Cloudflare Worker receives messages from my Telegram bot. It uploads any images to R2 storage, creates a markdown file, and commits it to GitHub via the API. The site rebuilds automatically. The whole pipeline costs nothing — Telegram bots are free, Cloudflare Workers has a generous free tier, R2 storage is free up to 10GB.

$0/month to text my blog. Not the phone number I originally wanted, but functionally equivalent and infinitely simpler to set up.

The first version worked: send a message, get a blog post. But something felt off. A stream of isolated posts, each with titles pulled from the first line of text. It felt fragmented.

The second version bundles everything by day. The first message of the day creates a post titled "December 5". Subsequent messages append to the same post, separated by tildes, each timestamped:

```
10:32 AM

First thought of the day

Wrapping up
```

A daily log instead of a scattered feed. One artifact per day capturing everything I found worth sharing. The tilde as a breath between moments.

~

The actual implementation is around 400 lines of TypeScript. The interesting parts:

**Checking if today's post exists:** Before creating anything, the worker fetches from GitHub's API to see if a file for today already exists. If it does, we append. If not, we create.

**Handling images:** Telegram sends photos in multiple sizes. The worker grabs the largest one, downloads it, uploads to R2, and embeds the URL in the markdown.

**The append logic:** Fetch existing content, decode from base64, add the new snippet with a tilde separator, encode, commit with the file's SHA for optimistic locking.

**Whitelisting:** Only messages from my Telegram user ID actually publish. Anyone else gets saved as a draft — useful if I ever want to let others contribute, with moderation.

~

Some things I'm still thinking about:

Images aren't working yet because I haven't set up the custom domain on R2. That's a five-minute task I keep not doing.

The timestamps are in UTC. They should probably be in my local timezone.

There's no way to edit or delete a snippet once it's posted. I'd have to do that through git directly. Maybe that's fine — the stream is meant to be raw and unpolished.

I could add commands: maybe `/delete` removes the last snippet, or `/clear` starts the day over. But adding features means adding complexity, and the whole point was reducing friction.

~

The code lives in a `workers/` directory in my site's repo. Setting it up requires:

1. Creating a Telegram bot (message @BotFather)
2. Deploying the Cloudflare Worker
3. Setting three secrets: GitHub token, Telegram bot token, your user ID
4. Pointing the webhook to your worker URL

The worker handles everything else.

~

What I like most about this system is that it makes publishing feel like texting a friend. No interface to navigate, no buttons to click. Just a conversation with my website.

The best tools disappear. They get out of the way and let you do the thing you actually want to do. Texting doesn't feel like "using an app" — it feels like communicating. Now publishing feels the same way.

I'm curious to see how this changes what I share. Lower friction should mean more sharing, but it might also mean more noise. We'll see. The stream will tell.
