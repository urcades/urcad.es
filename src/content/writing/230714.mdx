description: Notes on Materiality
---

On the walk to the office today, I was thinking about how it's great that you can generally grasp what a material will be "good" or "useful" for. Certain materials take to shaping, forming, or impressing methods in a more natural manner than others.

You can build a home out of a bricks, wood, composite materials, metals, etc. and expect the house to stick around for a while. Generally speaking, a house built in this manner won't make for a great jumping castle. Jumping castles don't really serve well as protective domains, etc.

Two days ago, I was speaking to a few people in the office about an old idea for a smart contract called *life.sol*. 

The basic model for this smart contract follows:

> A perceived issue of many digitally-bound organizations is that they feign the capability of 'lasting forever'.
>
> Without something like a life to grant an organization the 'gift' of death, which provokes people into long-term/far-reaching action, care for others, etc., organizations are predisposed to pointless "power" accumulation, stagnation, and a fate worse than death.
>
> Life.sol (or otherwise "smart contract") aims to grant the gift of a lifespan (eventual death) to digital organizations or holders of digital inventories/accounts.
>
> Life.sol is inspired from a moment in recent history where an organization (Learning Gardens) willingly succumbed to death and apparently bloomed a broader and more colorful variety of initiatives, organizations, and units after its passing.
>
> Life.sol is a smart contract with three primary functions:
>
> 1. First, Life is bound to an Ethereum account/wallet and watches over all contents associated with the account, tokens and contracts and otherwise
> 2. Second, Life ingests a small set of non-identifying personal information such as age and geographic location and outputs a smart contract with a duration that maps to an average human lifespan. Upon Life being deployed to the EVM, the duration is turned into a counter. When the counter reaches its upper bound, Life burns all contents associated with the account it is bound to.
> 3. Third, Life subdivides the previous function's duration into fractions representing the number of years duration represents. Arbitrary functions can be set to execute at the end of each fractional segment.

I couldn't tell you if this idea is actually useful, or good, but I think it's interesting from a *materiality* perspective.

Consider the average unit of software: 

How robust is this thing? 

What makes a type stronger than another type?

What's the structural integrity of the software I'm using?

What's SHA2 made of?

Is my software's longevity/hardness coupled to the organization that builds it?

Are arrays of u32 integers stone or dyneema?

How long can I expect a \<div> to last?

\*

While *life.sol* doesn't answer these questions directly, it engenders a sort of materiality in the form of granting a time-bounding to an arbitrary unit of software (whatever's inscribed against a number). While I might not ever know if a unit of software is like granite or moss, a unit of time can begin to grant materiality to an abstract thing, an idea, a concept, etc.

If I know something's going to only be around for 3 minutes, I begin to understand it like I understand a daffodil in the wind.
