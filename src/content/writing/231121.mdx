On November 16th, Cal and Osebo and I visited [Omar](https://omar.website) and [Andre](https://cwervo.com) of [Folk](https://folk.computer). It was a great get-together and the first time I've witnessed a Dynamicland-like system in person. It was awe-inspiring, to say the least. I'm hoping more opportunities to visit the system (or similar systems) will arise in the future.

Some topics we covered in no particular order:

1. papercraft i/o
2. mindstorms robotics kit paper pad
3. [AprilTags](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag) and what comes after
4. mise en place
5. pilgrimage
6. CNC alignment
7. environmental website building
8. computer vision
9. folklore form factors
10. animism

It had been several years since I last visited this particular warehouse Folk was located in. Back then, Cal and I worked out of a single studio bay and it was here we came up with some pretty novel ideas about personal/general/environmental computing that remain extremely relevant to some recent developments in general computing.

I was inspired to dig up some old sketches we'd worked on together or adjacent to one another approximately around this time.

One of these days I'll take the time to explain in detail some of what we'd been thinking about, and why it remains relevant.
