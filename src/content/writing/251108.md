It's been a little over a year since I decided to take a leap and start [Flower](https://www.flowercomputer.com) with Sam. 

Since then, we've assembled a small crew of four, leased office space near our good friends, built a variety of custom furniture, launched a social network named [Yuma](https://www.yuma.chat), threw an office-warming, and had a good time along the way. It feels like a small pirate crew, a band of people with an insane collective vision for the future.

In each of our own particular ways, we believe in magic and want to weave magic into the fabric of reality.

Jenny and I had a second daughter. Her name is [Daisy](/writing/250921/). Our first child, Elle, is starting to exhibit the ability to improvise humor. At breakfast the other day, she pretended to act mad, but would crack at the slightest sign of us smiling or laughing at her. She'd laugh and laugh and attempt to put on her serious face again, and we'd keep laughing in a loop...

Life of all sorts is blooming all over the place.

Without a doubt, attempting to build up a long-lasting organization and a small family at the same time is one of the most difficult things I've ever subjected myself to. I'm lucky to be surrounded by people in my life who impart great energy and optimism and wisdom, among other things. I am kept nourished through the harder times.

I was inspired to take a moment to reflect on the year for a mundane reason: We're actively reasoning through the next stage of our company's life, settling ourselves into a particular form optimized for the current market/economic macro (all companies are organisms of a certain sort, after all), and figuring out how to communicate it all succinctly and commercially in a manner that will have people seeing dollar signs, and so on.

I've been shopping out our latest company memo to some close friends and people who generally understand what we're up to. So far, each has recognized that we're chipping away at an unexpectedly huge problem area — A massive opportunity that appears to have slipped by most people's awareness in our industry. Our friends are starting to see. I think more people are going to see soon.

Flower has been established to transmute an inert world into a world full of life. If we're successful, you'll see the magic in all things.

Life of all sorts is blooming all over the place.

Perhaps the most succinct way to explain Flower is that we're interested in surfacing "the life of everything".

⚘
