In the Urbit universe, a new publication/print shop was making the rounds after printing out the hoon source code into a physical book. I ordered it out of curiosity and was enraged at the shoddy quality of the book, so I designed a book to beautifully contain the hoon source code. I set the type and designed the layout such that the source code took up enough of the page to form a perfect square of text in the book, with an ample bottom margin.

I intended to stuff the margin with notes and quips from everyone who'd contributed to the current state of the hoon source code, but never got around to it.
