"Being a Body" was a small workshop designed by Callil Capuozzo and I for a Library Science conference. The main theme of the workshop revolved around drawing three categories of cards which would inform the participant of 1) a hyperstructure they were to inhabit/roleplay as 2) a special capability they had access to and 3) a problem they had to overcome. This workshop allowed participants the chance to imagine what it might be like to "become infrastructure" and discover how they might navigate the world.
