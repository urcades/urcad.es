      <p><em>Project Context</em></p>
<p>I was contacted by FOAM’s CEO Ryan King to translate their <em>seed funding pitch deck</em> (specifically screenshots of a proto-interface in the deck) into an initial product that would ease <em>non-blockchain-aware</em> and <em>non-crypto-bro</em> individuals into new ways of thinking about urban space and land usage in general with respect to “value”.</p>
<p>My initial reflex was to set up a system of constraints from which I could work, which required me to audit the materials given to me and determine the core of what FOAM was all about.</p>
<p>Shown in the Figma embed below, I arranged the screenshots I was provided in a spatial manner (with expected actions flowing from left to right) and I strung them together using Figma's prototyping functionality. I was left with a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/WL9J2gCvV3mg6Uo6WV5Rq2IN/1.-UX-Audit?node-id=1432%3A363&amp;scaling=scale-down-width">rough sketch of an application</a> I could click through and take notes on.</p>

<p>I used this prototype and the notes I compiled as an artifact FOAM and I could rally around to communicate with one another what felt weird, neccessary, or unusable about the way the platform was initially communicated.</p>
<p>We came to an agreement that a form-based interface wasn't compelling, and given the spatial nature of where crypto-value was being held with FOAM, it made sense to bring forth the richness of space through an interactive map — an interface primitive most people have normalized and know how to use.</p>
<p>From this point, I began to develop high-level wireframes to structure the initial pass of the crypto map:</p>

<p>My initial designs involved incorporating the bare minimum of general affordances most other mapping applications offered — a search mechanism, a means of panning and zooming and centering the map, a means of representing Points of Interest on the map, etc.</p>

<p>Where this work took an interesting turn was in the structuring of &quot;crypto interfacing&quot; that needed to co-inhabit the viewport; Where would this information live? Where did the blockchain need to be surfaced? <em>Does</em> a blockchain need to be surfaced at all? Ever?</p>
