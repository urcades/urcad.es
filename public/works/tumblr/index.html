    <p>Tumblr: Various Works</p>

<p><em>Project(s) Context</em></p>
<p>Tumblr is a social network that popularized the concept of short-form “microblogging” around the time of its creation in 2007. Since then, Tumblr has become a cultural/memetic engine thanks to the people and fandoms that inhabit it.</p>
<p>I joined Tumblr in late 2015 where I was one of four product designers interfacing with six product managers, a team of around 50 product engineers, and numerous researchers, QA staff, a small brand team, and a dozen engineering leads. Over time, the size of the product design team dwindled until there were only two of us left by the time of my leave.</p>
<p><em>Role</em></p>
<p>At Tumblr, I wrangled the general cross-platform (iOS, Android, and Web) product design, leadership interfacing, consolidation, and iterative improvement of three key product aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Messaging/Activity:
<ul>
<li>On-comment <a href="https://support.tumblr.com/tagged/replies">replies</a>, <a href="https://support.tumblr.com/tagged/messaging">direct messaging</a>, &quot;Asks&quot;, and cross-platform messaging tooling like gifs, stickers, doodling, notifications, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Safety and User Security:
<ul>
<li>I redesigned and decluttered our sprawling post/user reporting flows, implemented safety features into messaging, finalized the design of Tumblr's &quot;Safe Mode&quot; (which <a href="https://lydiawhite.info/">Lydia White</a> started), and collaborated with others to ensure user safety mechanisms were accessible throughout the application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Onboarding:
<ul>
<li>New user onboarding was one of the last major product areas I was given to design outright. Prior to my involvement, it was a project which had been in ongoing development for two years. Integrating GDPR-required interfaces and prototyping &quot;Tumblr 2&quot; style interfacing was one of the last projects I took on before I left Tumblr.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Messaging</em></p>
<p>Shortly after I joined Tumblr, after I had gotten acclimated to our general design process and style of work/interaction with engineering, I was</p>
<p><em>Safety and User Security</em></p>
<p>Tumblr has always been</p>
<p><em>Onboarding</em></p>
<p>After Yahoo (and by extension, Tumblr) was acquired by Oath, company-wide priorities were switched over to integrating core advertising technologies between Oath and its subsidiaries, and the integration of systems such as GDPR.</p>
<p>I worked closely with a product manager and a few engineering leads to navigate various “streams of work and reshuffled prioritization hierarchies” during the redesign of user onboarding, a project which had been dragging on for months.</p>
<p>In order for “new onboarding” to be successful, we needed the following to be true of our work:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Every aspect</em> of the newly-structured onboarding needed to exude our new brand</li>
<li>Onboarding needed to integrate a combined “Oath Terms and GDPR Acceptance interface”</li>
<li>Onboarding needed to successfully convert creators of new accounts into lasting users by means of immediately depicting Tumblr’s value.</li>
</ol>
<p>It all started with the desire to unite the <a href="https://medium.com/@thisisdougrichard/some-updates-to-tumblr-112876234c2d">efforts the brand team had been actively outputting</a> and the actual expression of the product. As the creative team was tightly knit, this movement was sort of a grassroots effort that we had to communicate to the rest of the company, rather than an overt company direction we were told to take.</p>
